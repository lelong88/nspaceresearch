i am making a language learning app
the app's content is 100% generated by AI
new interactive experience is enabled by AI such as open-ended question/answer with feedback, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, generative bilingual contents for personalized kind of language podcast, ai-assisted reading where key vocab is extracted and explained in context, flashcard with automatic visual illustration, etc.
the app overarching concept is: personalized language curriculums. this means there are unlimited number of curriculums across all dimensions to fit user's specific needs: [3-day, 5-day, 7-day curriculums, etc.] x [specialized domains laws hospitality healthcare etc.] x [test preps GMAT GRE IELTS, etc.] x [vocab acquisition set as dictated by user] x [learning style preferences such as like reading vs listening, speaking fluency vs. smooth pronunciations] x [physical constraints: impaired-visual, hard hearing etc.] ...
the app UI/UX is designed for minimalism: new users choose a curriculum in the catalog, only one curriculum to be activated at one time
