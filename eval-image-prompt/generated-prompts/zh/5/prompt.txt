Flat vector diagram, scientific illustration, clean schematic lines, clinical accuracy, neutral functional palette, precise geometry, educational graphic, centered composition, isolated on white background. Exclude all text, letters, numbers, typography, labels, writing, symbols with text, logos, watermarks, signatures.
