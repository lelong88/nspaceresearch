A simplified cross-section of a human heart showing four chambers with smooth curved walls, connected to major blood vessels (aorta and pulmonary arteries) extending from the top, rendered in soft medical blue for the structure, pale red and blue tones distinguishing oxygenated and deoxygenated sides, with clean minimal outlines indicating blood flow direction through the chambers. Flat vector diagram, scientific illustration, clean schematic lines, clinical accuracy, neutral functional palette, precise geometry, educational graphic, centered composition, isolated on white background. Exclude all text, letters, numbers, typography, labels, writing, symbols with text, logos, watermarks, signatures. No photorealism, no 3D render, no complex background, no clutter, no heavy shadows, no realistic textures, no artistic abstraction, no distortion of key structures, no messy sketch.
