A simplified side view of a human brain with soft rounded lobes, connected to a single stylized neuron below it showing a cell body with branching dendrites and one long axon, a small electrical spark symbol near the neuron indicating neural activity, using soft medical blue for the brain, warm coral for the neuron, and pale grey background elements. Flat vector diagram, scientific illustration, clean schematic lines, clinical accuracy, neutral functional palette, precise geometry, educational graphic, centered composition, isolated on white background. Exclude all text, letters, numbers, typography, labels, writing, symbols with text, logos, watermarks, signatures. No photorealism, no 3D render, no complex background, no clutter, no heavy shadows, no realistic textures, no artistic abstraction, no distortion of key structures, no messy sketch.
