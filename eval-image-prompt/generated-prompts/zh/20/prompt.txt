A simplified cross-section diagram showing a coiled wire wrapped around an iron core, with curved magnetic field lines emanating outward in symmetrical loops from both ends, a small battery or power source connected to the wire indicating electrical current flow, rendered in medical blue for the wire coil, soft grey for the iron core, and subtle red arrows showing field direction. Flat vector diagram, scientific illustration, clean schematic lines, clinical accuracy, neutral functional palette, precise geometry, educational graphic, centered composition, isolated on white background. Exclude all text, letters, numbers, typography, labels, writing, symbols with text, logos, watermarks, signatures. No photorealism, no 3D render, no complex background, no clutter, no heavy shadows, no realistic textures, no artistic abstraction, no distortion of key structures, no messy sketch.
