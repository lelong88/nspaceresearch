A magnifying glass hovering over a simplified map with small scattered dots representing disease spread patterns, connected by faint curved lines showing transmission paths, using soft blue, muted teal, and warm coral accent colors. Flat vector diagram, scientific illustration, clean schematic lines, clinical accuracy, neutral functional palette, precise geometry, educational graphic, centered composition, isolated on white background. Exclude all text, letters, numbers, typography, labels, writing, symbols with text, logos, watermarks, signatures. No photorealism, no 3D render, no complex background, no clutter, no heavy shadows, no realistic textures, no artistic abstraction, no distortion of key structures, no messy sketch.
