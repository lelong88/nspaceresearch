A single simplified bacterial cell shown in cross-section with a clear oval outer membrane, wavy inner cytoplasm region, and a small circular nucleoid area in the center, surrounded by 2-3 tiny floating microorganism silhouettes (one rod-shaped, one spherical) to indicate the microscopic world, using soft medical blue for the main cell, pale teal for the cytoplasm, and muted coral for the nucleoid. Flat vector diagram, scientific illustration, clean schematic lines, clinical accuracy, neutral functional palette, precise geometry, educational graphic, centered composition, isolated on white background. Exclude all text, letters, numbers, typography, labels, writing, symbols with text, logos, watermarks, signatures. No photorealism, no 3D render, no complex background, no clutter, no heavy shadows, no realistic textures, no artistic abstraction, no distortion of key structures, no messy sketch.
