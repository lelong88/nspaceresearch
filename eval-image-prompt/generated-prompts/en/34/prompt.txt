A simplified cross-section view showing layered urban systems: a road surface on top with a small iconic car, underground pipes running horizontally beneath (one blue for water, one brown for sewage), and electrical cables, all neatly stacked in visible earth layers with soft brown and grey tones. Flat vector diagram, scientific illustration, clean schematic lines, clinical accuracy, neutral functional palette (medical blue, white, soft grey, small red accent), precise geometry, educational graphic, centered composition, isolated on white background. Exclude all text, letters, numbers, typography, labels, writing, symbols with text, logos, watermarks, signatures. No photorealism, no 3D render, no complex background, no clutter, no heavy shadows, no realistic textures, no artistic abstraction, no distortion of key structures, no messy sketch.
