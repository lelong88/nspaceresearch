A simplified closed system showing heat energy (orange-red wavy arrows) flowing into a cylindrical container with a movable piston rising upward, indicating energy conversion to work, with a small flame symbol beneath representing heat input, using warm orange, cool blue-grey for the container, and white background. Flat vector diagram, scientific illustration, clean schematic lines, clinical accuracy, neutral functional palette, precise geometry, educational graphic, centered composition, isolated on white background. Exclude all text, letters, numbers, typography, labels, writing, symbols with text, logos, watermarks, signatures. No photorealism, no 3D render, no complex background, no clutter, no heavy shadows, no realistic textures, no artistic abstraction, no distortion of key structures, no messy sketch.
