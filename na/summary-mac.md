# MAC (Manulife Agency Center) — Proposal Summary

## Background

Manulife Vietnam operates a **Branch Model**: the company owns and operates all branch offices, handling operations end-to-end. Sales leaders (SM, UM) focus purely on sales — coaching, recruiting, and production.

Competitors use a **General Agency (GA) Model** (franchise-like): agency leaders operate independently as business owners, handling everything from operations to customer service. This makes it easy for competitors to expand geographically but puts heavy burden on individual leaders.

### The Problem

- Branch Model is **slow and expensive to expand** — opening a new branch requires significant controllable expenses (CE: rent, utilities, equipment = 20–30% of FYP)
- Last 2 years: scandal issues forced Manulife to consolidate, strengthening presence only in existing markets (Hanoi, HCMC, Hai Phong, etc.)
- **85% of new business** comes from just the top 10 provinces — highly concentrated
- All sales activities are anchored to physical offices — can't recruit salespeople far from branches
- Compensation for sales leaders is **less competitive** than GA model competitors (though total cost is similar — Manulife's cost is heavy on CE, competitors' cost is heavy on PRE/production-related expenses)

## The MAC Solution

MAC (Manulife Agency Center) is a **hybrid approach** — smaller satellite offices that combine benefits of both models:
- Sales leaders open and operate small offices in new markets far from existing Manulife branches
- They remain under the existing Manulife structure (assigned to a Regional Head, same MOC requirements, same sales activity controls)
- They are **not** creating a new GA model — MAC leaders still receive SM compensation like any other SM

### Agency Hierarchy (for context)

| Level | Role | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Bottom | **Agent** | Individual sellers, earn direct commission |
| Middle | **UM+** (Unit Manager) | Earn commission from agents under them + can still sell directly |
| Top | **SM+** (Sales Manager, 10 ranks) | Give up direct selling, earn compensation based on company targets. Cannot earn agent/UM commission |

SM+ ranks (low → high): SM → SSM → ... → DRD → ... → AVP → VP → **RH (Regional Head)**

### Compensation Layers

| SM Type | Compensation Components |
|---------|------------------------|
| Regular SM | SM compensation |
| GTF SM (external hire, existing office) | SM comp + GTF scheme |
| GTF SM MAC (external hire, opens MAC) | SM comp + GTF scheme + **MAC scheme** |

## MAC Scheme Details

### Normal/Small MAC (Pilot 2025 — SM/SSM level)

Target: External hires (GTF) or internal leaders at SM/SSM rank. Office size: ~70 m².

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Office Setup** | 300M VND total (100M upfront upon signing, 200M reimbursed after company inspection). Signage paid by company and remains company property |
| **Monthly Office Allowance** | 8% of MAC's FYP (First Year Premium) |
| **Minimum Guarantee** (first 3 years) | Requires monthly sales activities. With activities but no 1mAA achievement: **20M VND/month**. With activities + 1mAA achieved: **40M VND/month**. No activities = no guarantee (only 8% FYP). Catchup mechanism: if missed monthly but achieved within 3–6 months, retroactive payout applies |

Pilot results (launched May 2025, 7 months): **8 MACs opened** (7 GTF external + 1 internal)

### Big MAC (New for 2026 — DRD+ level)

Target: Larger leaders from competitors (equivalent to large BM/GD on competitor side), entering at DRD rank or above. Office size: ~150 m².

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Office Setup** | **600M VND** |
| **Monthly Office Allowance** | 8% of MAC's FYP |
| **Minimum Guarantee** (first 3 years) | With activities but no 1mAA: **30M VND/month**. With activities + 1mAA: **60M VND/month** |

### Recruiter Benefits (applies to both Normal & Big MAC)

Internal leaders who recruit a MAC leader receive:

| Benefit | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **One-off Recruitment Bonus** | 50M VND per MAC recruited |
| **Monthly Bonus** | 3% of MAC's FYP for first 12 months (capped at 100M VND total) |

### Internal MAC (special case)

Same scheme as GTF MAC, but the 8% FYP + minimum guarantee only applies to **new agents recruited after the MAC contract signing date** — existing team production is excluded.

## Comparison: Normal MAC vs Big MAC

| | Normal MAC | Big MAC |
|---|-----------|---------|
| Target rank | SM / SSM | DRD+ |
| Office size | ~70 m² | ~150 m² |
| Office setup | 300M VND | 600M VND |
| Monthly allowance | 8% FYP | 8% FYP |
| Guarantee (with 1mAA) | 40M VND/month | 60M VND/month |
| Guarantee (without 1mAA) | 20M VND/month | 30M VND/month |
| Guarantee period | 3 years | 3 years |

## Status & Next Steps

- 2025: Pilot phase approved locally by Manulife Vietnam EMT
- 2026: Proposing to **regional level** for official ongoing scheme (not just one-year pilot)
- Objectives: capture new markets + expand recruitment pool from competitor markets

### Immediate Tasks

1. **Cost simulation file for Big MAC** — similar to existing Normal MAC cost file, adapted for 600M setup / 60M guarantee figures
2. **Competitive analysis** — compare Manulife MAC compensation vs competitor offerings for equivalent leader profiles. Needs to cover both Normal MAC and Big MAC. Reference file exists for Normal MAC from last year (needs refinement); Big MAC analysis is new or only in draft
