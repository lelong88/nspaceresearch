# VAR Analysis | By UM direct team (rolling 12 months)

![Source](../images/17.jpg)

## Summary

- Current VaR exposure is only 0.3 mil USD, equivalent to ~ 0.6% of Agency FYP in 2025, which remains significantly below the approved trigger threshold of 3 mil USD
- Out of the 0.3mil USD,
  - ~0.05mil USD VaR comes from cases where production is 0 or negative but payout is positive; this due to:
    - Timing gaps between payment and period that production occur (e.g., deferred payment of previously earned retention bonuses);
    - Payout includes income generated from indirect team while FYP captures only direct team production → This results payouts was based on larger team production but is compared against smaller FYP
  - After minus these cases, total VaR is ~0.24mil USD, which quite similar to CAFR under new scheme based on 2025 back test data
  - At the same time, we monitor closely on the actual VaR and implement controls to mitigate the risk on monthly basis LineIB will conduct monthly screening for compensation payout ratios with other risk indicators to identify suspicions cases; conduct in-depth analyses when triggered; suspension of compensation payment, when required, for high risk cases and this suspension remains in place until the investigation is completed.

## VaR methodology

*[Formula diagram showing]:*

**VaR = (S) Total Payout - (|||) Total FYP**

- VaR Direct Team of UM: = ∑Sum of payout in **last 12 months** - ∑FYP of all **FA direct & UM.**
- Only count at month of rank UM+ and Only count UM with VaR direct team L12M >0, **zero/es team with negative value**
- VaR Agency = ∑Sum of all VaR direct team L12M >0
- Approved Trigger Point VAR: **$ 3.0 mil USD**

## Actual performance of UM+ with VaR > 0:
