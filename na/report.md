# VAR Historical Summary (2020–2026 Jan)

## Absolute VAR (Rolling 12M, mil USD)

| Year | Range | Year-End |
|------|-------|----------|
| 2020 | $1.7M–$2.2M | $1.7M |
| 2021 | $1.7M–$2.0M | $2.0M |
| 2022 | $2.0M–$3.8M | $3.8M |
| 2023 | $2.6M–$3.8M | $2.6M |
| 2024 | $0.4M–$2.4M | $0.4M |
| 2025 | $0.2M–$0.3M | $0.3M |
| 2026 | $0.3M (Jan only) | — |

## Key Observations

**The $3M threshold was breached.** VAR crossed $3M in Q4 2022 (Oct $3.0M, Nov $3.2M, Dec $3.8M) and stayed above or near $3M through most of 2023 (Jan–Aug ranged $3.4M–$3.8M). It then dropped sharply through 2023 H2 and into 2024.

**2020–2021 was the "normal" baseline** — VAR hovered around $1.7M–$2.0M, comfortably under the $3M threshold.

**2022–2023 was the spike period** — VAR climbed steadily through 2022 and peaked at $3.8M (Dec 2022 and May 2023). This is the period where the threshold would have been triggered repeatedly.

**2024 saw a dramatic decline** — from $2.4M in Jan down to $0.4M by Sep, where it stayed through year-end. This is the transition into the "good year."

**2025 is the floor** — $0.2M–$0.3M all year. Historically the lowest level by far.

## %VAR DT/FYP (Positive-VAR Agents Only)

Notably, 2024 showed the highest ratios (up to 71.6% in Sep) despite low absolute VAR. This means the few agents still showing positive VAR were individually very concentrated — their payouts massively exceeded their FYP. The broad population cleaned up, but the remaining outliers were extreme.

2025 ratios came back down to the 27–50% range, closer to 2020–2021 norms (~27–32%).

## %VAR/FYP Agency (Broad Base)

This stayed below 1% in 2020–2021, spiked to 3–4% in 2023, then dropped back to 0.3–0.6% in 2024–2025. Confirms the same pattern: the 2022–2023 period was the anomaly, current levels are historically low.

## Implications for the Threshold Proposal

- A threshold of **$3M was clearly too high** in hindsight — it only got breached during the 2022–2023 spike, and even then it didn't catch the early buildup.
- The "normal" range (2020–2021) was **$1.7M–$2.0M**.
- Setting the new threshold somewhere in the **$1.5M–$2.0M** range would have caught the 2022 escalation earlier while still giving enough room above the current $0.3M to avoid false triggers from routine business fluctuations.
