## Key Insights

❖ Due to multilevel Agency hierarchy and overlapping production, we review VaR amount at each PSM+ reporting level and observed Agency VaR to be **negative in past 4 years**.

❖ Overall year-on-year trend, VaR increased over time mostly because VN Agency experienced significant changes business volume (from ~200mil USD in 2021-22 to ~71mil in 2023 and Y11024I1 at 45m USD), changes in key sales driver from new agents segment to core agents while compensation design more favorable to higher performers.

❖ We also observed that VaR amount increases as we move **further to lower reporting level**.

❖ With negative VaR at PSM+ level, to **leverage VaR as an early indicator** for potential exposure, we'd need to identify **which level** across agency hierarchy **measure and sum up their arbitrage opportunities as Company's exposure**.

✓ Arbitrage risk more **likely to happen & driven by FA & UM+ layers**, we propose measure at **Units level**

✓ **For arbitrage risk control:**

• We will **monitor Agency VaR at Units level** and continue reviewing VaR tool for any enhancement if needed

• In addition, Local Agency compensation team will **monitor total payout of PSM+ income on monthly basis** to flag any **significant fluctuation** and coordinate with Line 1B to discuss next action

• Agency Line1B **continue to conduct payout review together with other risk indicators to red flag at individual Agents/ UM+/ PSM+** on monthly basis

• When violation of FA/UM+ found related to their PSM+, company can exercise claw back clause in high rewards scheme agreement, suspend their enrollment for big campaigns, or terminate their contracts ...
