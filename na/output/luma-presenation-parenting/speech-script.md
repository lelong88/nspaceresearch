# Speech Script — LUMA Coaching Session Presentation

**Total target time: ~5 minutes**

---

## Slide 1 — Title & Introduction (~30 seconds)

> Hi everyone, I'm Tien Phan. Thank you for joining this coaching session.
>
> Today I'd like to share how I applied Design Thinking from the LUMA Practitioner Program to a real-life challenge — not a work project, but something very personal: parenting.

---

## Slide 2 — The Challenge (~1 minute)

> So here's my challenge. I have two young daughters — one is four years old and the other is two. They come home from school every day at around 4 PM, Monday through Friday.
>
> The thing is, my wife and I are both at work during that time. A caregiver stays with them at home and is responsible for guiding their afternoon activities.
>
> Both girls attend a Steiner — or Waldorf — school, so we wanted after-school activities that complement what they're already learning. But the activities also need to be diverse, age-appropriate for each child, and — this is key — simple enough for the caregiver to follow and instruct on her own, without us being there to explain.
>
> That's the challenge I decided to tackle using LUMA methods.

## Slide 3 — Methods Used (~1 minute 30 seconds)

> Let me walk you through my recipe — the LUMA methods I used.
>
> First, **Stakeholder Mapping**. I mapped out everyone involved: the children, the caregiver, us as parents, and even the school teachers. This helped me understand each person's needs and constraints — for example, the caregiver's comfort level with different types of activities.
>
> Next, **Interviewing**. I had conversations with the caregiver and the teachers to understand daily routines, what the children enjoy, and where the gaps are in their current activities.
>
> Then I used **Rose, Thorn, Bud** to evaluate our previous activity plans. What was working well? What was frustrating? And where did we see untapped potential?
>
> Finally, **Creative Matrix**. I cross-referenced different activity types — like creative play, motor skills, language, and sensory activities — with developmental goals for each age group. This helped generate a wide range of ideas systematically.
>
> Each method built on the previous one, moving from understanding to ideation to planning.

## Slide 4 — Outcomes (~45 seconds)

> So what came out of this process?
>
> I created a structured weekly activity plan, Monday through Friday, tailored to each child's age. I also designed simple, visual instruction cards that the caregiver can follow independently — no phone calls needed.
>
> The activities are a balanced mix of creative play, motor skills, language, and sensory work. And while they complement the Steiner philosophy, I also brought in elements from Montessori and Reggio Emilia to fill in gaps.
>
> We also set up a feedback loop: the caregiver notes what works and what doesn't, and we iterate the plan every week.
>
> The biggest win? The caregiver now feels confident running activities on her own.

## Slide 5 — Rose, Thorn & Bud Reflection (~45 seconds)

> Let me reflect on how it went using the Rose, Thorn, and Bud framework.
>
> **Rose**: Design Thinking made the whole planning process systematic instead of ad-hoc. Stakeholder Mapping made sure I didn't miss anyone's perspective. And the caregiver reported that the children are more engaged.
>
> **Thorn**: It was time-consuming to prepare detailed instruction cards at first. It was also hard to predict exactly which activities suit a two-year-old versus a four-year-old. And the caregiver needed some time to adjust to the new format.
>
> **Bud**: I see potential to build a reusable activity template library. I'd also love to explore co-designing activities with the children themselves. And this approach could easily extend to weekends and holidays.

## Slide 6 — Learn More & Close (~30 seconds)

> To wrap up, there are a few things I'd love to explore with you all.
>
> How can I better sequence LUMA methods for personal challenges like this? Are there tips for co-designing with very young children? And how have any of you applied Design Thinking outside of traditional work contexts?
>
> Thank you! I'm looking forward to your feedback and questions.
