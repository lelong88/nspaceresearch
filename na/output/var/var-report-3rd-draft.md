**CONFIDENTIAL — INTERNAL USE ONLY**

### Agency VAR Threshold Analysis & Proposal

Comprehensive review of Value-at-Risk exposure for the agency salesforce,
historical trend analysis, and proposed threshold recalibration for 2026

Agency Risk & Compensation Review | February 2026

---

## Slide 2: Executive Summary — Key Findings at a Glance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current VAR (2025 Actual) | $0.3M |
| Approved Trigger (Legacy) | $3.0M |
| Forecast VAR 2026 | $0.85M |
| Proposed Trigger Point | $1.5M |

### Why VAR Was Low in 2025
- Conduct reviews cleaned out high-risk teams (policy churning, mass cancellations), leaving a healthier salesforce
- Business downturn: recruitment declined ~60% in H1 2024 vs 2023; high persistency kept FYP strong
- After excluding timing-gap cases, clean VAR ≈ $0.24M — aligned with CAFR arbitrage risk assessment

### Why the Threshold Matters
- Breaching the threshold triggers a mandatory risk protocol — deep-dive analysis and escalation
- New compensation scheme (2026) increases UM+ income significantly, pushing VAR from $0.3M → ~$0.85M
- Legacy $3.0M threshold is too high given current risk profile; $1.5M represents proactive 50% tightening

### VAR Summary

| Metrics | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 |
|---------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| Avg VaR (Mn USD) | 1.9 | 1.8 | 2.5 | 3.5 | 1.1 | 0.3 |
| Ending %VaR/FYP | 0.8% | 0.8% | 1.9% | 3.6% | 0.7% | 0.6% |
| Peak %VaR/FYP | 1.3% (Jan) | 0.8% (Dec) | 1.9% (Dec) | 4.0% (Nov) | 3.6% (Jan) | 0.6% (Jan) |

### Key Narrative (updated with performance context)

**2020-2022: Stable Period (VaR ~$1.8-2.0M)**
- Mass agent recruitment ~50K-60K new recruits/year with tremendous leader (UM+) manpower (6K-9K UM+)
- Agency FYP ~$200+ mil/year; new agents (M0-M12) accounted for ~50% of business
- Top agent cohort contributed ~30% of FYP; core agents ~25-32%
- VAR stable because high production volume offset high payout levels

**2022-2023: Spike to ~$3.8M**
- Deferred payment from 2022 peak production flowing into 2023
- FYP collapsed from $204M (2022) to $72M (2023) — a 67% drop
- Commission structures remained unchanged (FYC = 40%, avg commission = 32%)
- VAR/FYP peaked at 4.0% — the outlier year

**2024-2025: Sharp Decline to $0.3M**
- FYP stabilized at $50-53M; conduct reviews cleaned salesforce
- Commission rate reduced to avg 26% (from 32%)
- Core agent contribution surged to 56% (2024) → 65% (2025) due to downsizing
- New agent contribution dropped to 13-15% (from 50%+ in 2020-2022)
- UM+ count dropped from 5,999 (2023) to 2,600 (2024)

**2026 Forecast Context**
- FYP target: $72M (back to 2023 level, +35% growth)
- Commission rate: ~26% (lower than 2023's 32%)
- New compensation scheme increases UM+ income significantly
- Core agent contribution remains high (>65%) — may buffer VAR

## Slide 4: Historically Low 2025 VaR of $0.29 mil USD

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total VaR (Gross) | $0.29 mil |
| Timing Gap Cases | $0.05 mil |
| VaR Excluding Timing Gap Cases | $0.24 mil |
| Units with VaR > 0 | 260 |

### Summary

- Current VaR exposure ending 2025 (rolling 12 months) is **$0.29 mil USD**, equivalent to **~0.6% of Agency FYP** in 2025, significantly below the approved trigger threshold of $3 mil USD

- Out of the $0.29 mil USD VaR:
  - **~$0.05 mil USD** comes from cases where production is 0 or negative but payout is positive, due to:
    - Timing gaps between payment and period that production occurs (e.g., deferred payment of previously earned retention bonuses)
    - Payout includes income generated from indirect team while FYP captures only direct team production → payouts based on larger team production compared against smaller FYP
  - After excluding these cases, total VaR is **~$0.24 mil USD**, which aligns with total risk exposure amount forecasted by CAFR arbitrage risk assessment (calculated by multiplying risk exposed amount of each assumed scenario with number of teams that meet key assumptions based on 2025 back test)

- 260 UM+ contributing to total positive VaR of $0.29 mil USD

- Monthly monitoring: Line1B conducts monthly screening for compensation payout ratios with other risk indicators to identify suspicious cases; conducts in-depth analyses when triggered; suspension of compensation payment for high risk cases until investigation is completed

## Slide 5: Units with VaR > 0: Profile & Performance (UPDATED)

### Profile Overview
- **63%** are Non-GTF
- **95%** are Non-MBA Pro
- **72%** have Low VaR (<$1,000 USD L12M)

### Distribution by VaR Amount and Payout/FYP

| % Payout/FYP | <$1,000 | <$2,000 | <$4,000 | ≥$4,000 | Total units |
|--------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| FYP = 0, Payout > 0 | 67 | 8 | 3 | — | 78 |
| FYP < 0, Payout > 0 | 4 | 3 | 1 | — | 8 |
| FYP < 0, Payout < 0 | 4 | 2 | — | — | 6 |

### Overall Performance of Units with FYP > 0 & Payout > 0

| Metric | Non MBA Pro | MBA Pro Silver | MBA Pro Gold | MBA Pro Platinum | Total |
|--------|-------------|----------------|--------------|------------------|-------|
| # UM with VaR DT L12M > 0 | 166 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 168 |
| GTF | 40 | 1 | 4 | — | 45 |
| Non GTF | 115 | 3 | — | 4 | 123 |
| Avg FYP direct report/month (mil VND) | 32 | 107 | 48 | 314 | 44 |
| Avg FYP personal/month (mil VND) | 13 | 24 | 4 | 60 | 14 |

| Avg NR in 2025 YTD | 2.3 | 3.8 | 1.0 | 6.3 | 2.5 |

### Key Insight on 72% Low-VaR Units (NEW — addresses feedback)
- 187 units (72%) have VaR < $1,000 in L12M, contributing only $66K total (22% of total VaR)
- These are predominantly non-MBA Pro, non-GTF units with low production
- %VaR/FYP for this group is minimal — acceptable risk level
- The 18 units with VaR ≥ $4,000 account for $130K (44% of total VaR) — see deep dive below

---

## Slide 6: Deep Dive — 18 High-Exposure Units (VaR ≥$4,000) (NEW SLIDE)

### Profile of 18 High-Exposure Units

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total VaR contribution | $130K (44% of total $293K VaR) |
| All 18 units | FYP > 0 & Payout > 0 segment |
| GTF vs Non-GTF | Mix of both |
| MBA Pro representation | Includes some Silver/Platinum |

### Characteristics
- These 18 units have disproportionate VaR contribution ($130K out of $293K total)
- Primarily driven by:
  - High UM+ compensation (overrides + activation bonuses) relative to direct team FYP
  - Structural formula asymmetry: income from full hierarchy vs FYP from direct team only
  - Some units have large indirect teams generating override income not offset by FYP
- %VaR/FYP for these units ranges from moderate to high, warranting individual monitoring
- None flagged for conduct issues — VAR driven by compensation structure, not fraud signals

### Recommended Action
- Individual case monitoring on monthly basis
- Cross-reference with Line1B risk indicators
- Review if compensation structure adjustments needed for outlier cases

---

## Slide 7: Bonus Contribution Breakdown — Units with VaR > 0

### UM+ income dominates VaR exposure (43%)

| Income Component | Amount (K USD) | % of Total |
|-----------------|----------------|------------|
| **Total Payout** | **1,214** | **100%** |
| 1) FYC | 305 | 25% |
| 2) Agent Income | 392 | 32% |
| — Agent Compensation | 192 | 16% |
| — Agent Contest | 107 | 15% |
| 3) UM+ Income | 517 | 43% |
| — UM+ Compensation | 372 | 31% |
| —— Override | 228 | 19% |
| —— Team activation bonus | 125 | 10% |
| —— Other compensation bonuses | 19 | 2% |
| — GTF Subsidy | 45 | 4% |
| — UM+ Contest | 85 | 7% |

### Key Finding
- UM+ compensation — particularly leader overrides ($228K, 19%) and leader activation ($125K, 10%) — is the largest contributor to positive-VaR units
- Arbitrage risk is most likely at UM+ layer where UM+ can influence their unit production

## Slide 8: High-Risk Segments: Zero-FYP & Negative-FYP Units (UPDATED)

### Verified: Defer payment is the main driver (addresses feedback)

#### FYP = 0 & Payout > 0 (78 units, $36.6K VaR)

| Component | Amount | % | Note |
|-----------|--------|---|------|
| Total VaR / Payout | $36.6K | 100% | |
| 1) FYC | $0.1K | 0% | |
| 2) Agent Income | $19.3K | 53% | |
| — Agent_NAB_FT | $3.2K | 9% | Defer payment |
| — Agent_Mpro_monthly | $1K | 1% | Defer payment |
| — Agent Contest | $15.0K | 41% | Defer payment |
| 3) UM+ Income | $17.1K | 47% | |
| — Leader_override | $1.9K | 5% | Based on FYC direct & indirect |
| — Leader_develop_new agent | $1.2K | 3% | Defer payment |
| — Leader_new UM | $0.3K | 1% | Defer payment |
| — **GTF Subsidy (9 units)** | **$8.1K** | **22%** | **Based on FYC direct & indirect** |
| — Leader contest | $5.4K | 15% | Defer payment |

**Verification**: 66% of defer payment components confirmed. Main driver is production from prior year being paid in current year.

#### FYP < 0 & Payout > 0 (7 units, $10.9K VaR) — updated from 8 to 7 units

| Component | Amount | % | Note |
|-----------|--------|---|------|
| Total VaR | $10.9K | — | |
| Total Payout | $5.4K | 100% | |
| 1) FYC (negative) | ($2.0K) | -36% | |
| 2) Agent Income | $4.2K | 77% | |
| — Agent Contest | $3.2K | 59% | Defer payment |
| 3) UM+ Income | $3.2K | 60% | |
| — Leader_override | $0.8K | 15% | Based on FYC direct & indirect |
| — Leader contest | $1.8K | 34% | Defer payment |

#### FYP < 0 & Payout < 0 (6 units, $4K VaR)
- Minimal exposure; payout negative means net recovery
- No action required

### GTF Subsidy: Risk Component — With Claw-Back
- GTF subsidy = 22% of VaR in zero-FYP units ($8.1K of $36.6K)
- GTF subsidy calculated on net production — does not require passing free-look period
- Claw-back mechanism exists: if GTF terminates within 12–18 months, must repay subsidy received in first 6 months

## Slide 9: Performance — Non-GTF Units (FYP DT > 0, Payout > 0)

### By %Payout/FYP

| %Payout / FYP DT | >0-<4K | ≥4-<20K | ≥20-<60K | ≥60K | Total |
|-------------------|--------|---------|----------|------|-------|
| ≥100% - <120% | 16 | 17 | 6 | 2 | 33% |
| ≥120% - <150% | 17 | 9 | 1 | 1 | 23% |
| ≥150% - <180% | 12 | — | — | — | 10% |

| ≥250% - <300% | 2 | — | — | — | 2% |
| ≥300% | 34 | — | — | — | 28% |
| Total | 5% | 21% | 6% | 2% | 100% |

### Comment
1. **By %Payout/FYP**: 66% of units have ratio below 150%. 4% with ratio exceeding 250% mostly belong to low-production groups (FYP L12M < 4K USD), where payouts are primarily driven by deferred-payment components.
2. **By leader segment**: 6% represent Top Leader segment (MBA Pro) with FYP DT L12M ≥ 4K USD, ≥2 1mAA/month, avg 1 NR/month. 94% are Non MBA Pro.

## Slide 10: Performance — GTF Units (FYP DT > 0, Payout > 0)

### By %Payout/FYP

| %Payout / FYP DT | >0-<4K | ≥4-<20K | ≥20-<60K | ≥60K | Total |
|-------------------|--------|---------|----------|------|-------|
| ≥100% - <120% | 7 | 5 | — | — | 27% |
| ≥120% - <150% | 12 | 1 | — | — | 29% |

| ≥300% | 10 | — | — | — | 22% |
| Total | 84% | 16% | 0% | 0% | 100% |

### Comment
1. **By %Payout/FYP**: 56% of units have ratio below 150%. 12 units (~26%) with ratio exceeding 250% mostly belong to low-production groups (FYP L12M < 4K USD), where payouts are primarily driven by non-deferred-payment components.
2. **By leader segment**: 11% represent Top Leader segment (MBA Pro, ~5 units). 89% are Non MBA Pro (~40 units).

## Slide 11: 2026 Compensation Change Impact: Back-Test & Forecast (UPDATED)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 2025 Actual (Old Scheme) | $0.3 mil |
| 2025 Back-Test (New Scheme) | $0.48 mil |
| 2026 Forecast (New Scheme) | $0.85 mil |
| FYP Growth Target | +35% |

### Back-Test 2025 (New compensation scheme on actual performance 2025)

| Segment | Non-MBA | Silver | Gold | Platinum | Total |
|---------|---------|--------|------|----------|-------|
| VaR (K USD) | 378 | 83 | 18 | 2 | 481 |
| # Units VAR>0 | 190 | 6 | 3 | 3 | 202 |
| GTF | 45 | 2 | 1 | — | 48 |
| Non-GTF | 145 | 4 | 2 | 3 | 154 |

### Forecast 2026 (New compensation scheme + Forecast growth 2026 FYP)

| Segment | Non-MBA | Silver | Gold | Platinum | Total |
|---------|---------|--------|------|----------|-------|
| VaR (K USD) | 421 | 224 | 94 | 117 | 856 |
| # Units VAR>0 | 260 | 18 | 15 | 13 | 306 |
| GTF | 108 | 4 | — | — | 112 |
| Non-GTF | 96 | 9 | 7 | 7 | 119 |

### Divergent Trends by Segment (addresses feedback)
- **Non-MBA Pro VaR drops 19%** ($860K→$694K): under new scheme, income of non-MBA only +3% while FYP grows >35%
- **MBA Pro VaR surges 3.2×** ($190K→$598K): new scheme boosts top-performer MBA UM+ compensation
- **GTF units with VAR>0 increase 18%** (105→124) despite total units declining 22%
  - Root cause: production increase causes some GTF units to jump to higher compensation tiers
  - GTF compensation scheme unchanged but higher production → higher tier rates → disproportionate income increase
  - Majority are non-MBA GTF (119 of 124)

### 2026 VAR Forecast Model (NEW — addresses feedback)
- FYP forecast = $72M (equivalent to 2023 level)
- Commission rate = ~26% (lower than 2023's 32% → 6pp reduction)
- New compensation scheme significantly increases UM+ income (especially MBA Pro)
- Core agent contribution >65% → higher quality production may buffer some VAR
- Net effect: VAR forecast $0.85M, well below 2023 peak of $3.5M despite similar FYP level
- Key difference from 2023: lower commission rate + cleaner salesforce + no mass recruitment

---

## Slide 12: $1.5 mil Trigger Point Proposal (UPDATED from 2nd draft)

### Progression
| State | Value | Context |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Current (2025 Actual) | $0.3M | Historically low due to high producer attrition, reduced manpower, business downturn |
| Expected (2026 Forecast) | $0.85M | Under new compensation scheme with 35% FYP growth |
| Proposed Trigger | $1.5M | Reduced from legacy $3.0M — a 50% tightening |

### Rationale for $1.5M
- **Proactive 50% tightening** from legacy $3.0M threshold, demonstrating strengthened risk controls
- **Calibrated against 2026 forecast** ($0.85M) under new compensation scheme
- **Supported by structurally cleaner salesforce** following 2024-2025 conduct reviews

### Buffer from $0.85M to $1.5M absorbs:
- **Structural formula asymmetry**: Income includes earnings from entire team hierarchy, but FYP only captures direct-team production. A UM+ with large indirect team can show positive VAR even without risk
- **New product ILP**: Higher case size (min premium = 2.5× current case size) can drive productivities for certain producers and their leaders; compensation structure rewards higher productivity with higher rates
- **Normal business fluctuations**: Seasonal patterns, deferred payments, one-off retention packages

### Comprehensive monthly monitoring framework with multi-indicator screening remains in place regardless of threshold level

---

## Slide 13: VAR Monitoring & Control Framework

| Action Item | Owner | Frequency | Timeline |
|-------------|-------|-----------|----------|
| Dashboard Channel VaR report development | ASBD | — | 2025 Q1 |
| Monitor total payout incl. PSM+ for significant fluctuations | ASBD | Monthly | Ongoing |
| Review VaR monitoring tool for enhancement | ASBD | Quarterly | Ongoing |
| Deep-dive payout data: compensation components, agency segments | ASBD | Monthly | From Mar '25 |
| Red-flag investigation: multi-indicator screening | Line1B | Monthly | Already in place |
| Update tracking in Local ARC; escalate to ARC/RCSC when breached | Line1B | Monthly | From Mar '25 |
| Embed VAR impact review in annual compensation review | ASBD | Annual | 2025 Q4 |

### Escalation Protocol When Threshold Is Breached
When monthly VAR exceeds $1.5M, the local Compensation team and Line1B must provide a deep-dive analysis. Line1B already manages monthly protocols for other risk controls — integrated into existing workflows.

---

## Slide 14: Conclusion & Recommendation

| State | Value | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Current State | $0.3M | 2025 actual VAR — historically low due to high persistency, reduced manpower, and business downtrend |
| Expected State | $0.85M | 2026 forecast under new compensation scheme with 35% FYP growth |
| Proposed Trigger | $1.5M | Reduced from legacy $3.0M — a 50% tightening. Provides ~1.76× buffer above forecast |

The $1.5M trigger point represents a proactive 50% tightening from the legacy $3.0M threshold. It is calibrated against the 2026 forecast ($0.85M), supported by a structurally cleaner salesforce following 2024-2025 conduct reviews. The comprehensive monthly monitoring framework with multi-indicator screening remains in place regardless of threshold level.

All data as of January 2026
