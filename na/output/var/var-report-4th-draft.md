# Agency VAR Threshold Analysis & Proposal — 4th Draft

## Changes from 3rd Draft (based on feedback in var-3rd-draft-feedback meetings)

1. Slide 1 (VAR History): Enhanced 2025 trend explanation — detailed why VAR is low through agency FYP decline, stable co-agent/new-agent mix, and reduced salesforce (CA at 13.6K = 1/4-1/5 of prior years)
2. Profile overview updated: 87% of units have VAR < $2,000 (was 72% < $1,000 in 3rd draft), contributing 40% of total VAR — acceptable risk level
3. NEW: P13 persistency analysis for 168 units with FYP>0 & Payout>0 — 76 with good P13 (≥60%), 16 with low P13 but small VAR (<$2K), 76 without P13 (new UM or GTF <12 months)
4. NEW: Deep dive on 5 GTF top UM units with VAR ≥$4,000 — root cause is calculation mismatch (Direct Report for UMC/GTF subsidy vs Direct Team for FYP in VAR). 90% payout from UMC (31%) + GTF Subsidy (57%). Not actual risk.
5. Combined old slides 7 & 8 (GTF analysis) into one summary slide per feedback
6. Special cases profile clarified: 100% non-top UM, 100% non-MBA, 50%+ are GTF

### Agency VAR Threshold Analysis & Proposal

Comprehensive review of Value-at-Risk exposure for the agency salesforce,
historical trend analysis, and proposed threshold recalibration for 2026

Agency Risk & Compensation Review | February 2026

## Slide 2: Executive Summary — Key Findings at a Glance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current VAR (2025 Actual) | $0.3M |
| Approved Trigger (Legacy) | $3.0M |
| Forecast VAR 2026 | $0.85M |
| Proposed Trigger Point | $1.5M |

### Why VAR Was Low in 2025
- Agency FYP declined significantly from $200M+ (2020-2022) to ~$53M in 2025
- Co-agent contribution stable (~65%), new agent contribution dropped to 13% (from 50%+ in 2020-2022)
- Salesforce dramatically reduced: CA ending Dec 2025 at 13.6K (only 1/4 to 1/5 of prior years)
- UM count also declined significantly
- Conduct reviews cleaned out high-risk teams
- After excluding timing-gap cases, clean VAR ≈ $0.24M — aligned with CAFR arbitrage risk assessment
- VAR absolute amount: ~$0.3-0.4M, very stable throughout 2025

### Why the Threshold Matters
- Breaching the threshold triggers a mandatory risk protocol — deep-dive analysis and escalation
- New compensation scheme (2026) increases UM+ income significantly, pushing VAR from $0.3M → ~$0.85M
- Legacy $3.0M threshold is too high given current risk profile; $1.5M represents proactive 50% tightening

### Key Narrative — Why 2025 VAR is Low and Stable ($0.3-0.4M)

**Root Causes of Low 2025 VAR:**
1. **Agency FYP declined significantly** — from $200M+ (2020-2022) to ~$53M in 2025
2. **Agent mix stable but shifted to lower-risk profile** — co-agent (core agent) contribution at ~65%, similar % contribution as prior years but new agent contribution dropped from 50%+ to 13%. Co-agents typically have lower VAR; new agents (who receive higher initial compensation) have declined
3. **Salesforce dramatically reduced** — CA ending Dec 2025 at 13.6K, only 1/4 to 1/5 compared to prior years. UM count also declined significantly
4. **Conduct reviews** cleaned out high-risk teams (policy churning, mass cancellations)
5. **VAR absolute amount stable at $0.3-0.4M** throughout 2025 — no volatility

**Historical Context:**
- 2020-2022: Stable period (VaR ~$1.8-2.0M) with mass recruitment, high FYP, large salesforce
- 2022-2023: Spike to ~$3.8M driven by FYP collapse (67% drop) while compensation unchanged
- 2024-2025: Sharp decline to $0.3M — reduced salesforce, lower commission, cleaner teams

## Slide 4: Historically Low 2025 VaR of $0.29 mil USD

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total VaR (Gross) | $0.29 mil |
| Timing Gap Cases | $0.05 mil |
| VaR Excluding Timing Gap Cases | $0.24 mil |
| Units with VaR > 0 | 260 |

### Summary

- Current VaR exposure ending 2025 (rolling 12 months) is **$0.29 mil USD**, equivalent to **~0.6% of Agency FYP** in 2025, significantly below the approved trigger threshold of $3 mil USD

- Out of the $0.29 mil USD VaR:
  - **~$0.05 mil USD** comes from cases where production is 0 or negative but payout is positive, due to:
    - Timing gaps between payment and period that production occurs (e.g., deferred payment of previously earned retention bonuses)
    - Payout includes income generated from indirect team while FYP captures only direct team production
  - After excluding these cases, total VaR is **~$0.24 mil USD**, aligned with CAFR arbitrage risk assessment

- 260 UM+ contributing to total positive VaR of $0.29 mil USD

- Monthly monitoring: Line1B conducts monthly screening for compensation payout ratios with other risk indicators; suspension of compensation payment for high risk cases until investigation is completed

## Slide 5: Units with VaR > 0: Profile & Performance (UPDATED from 3rd draft)

### Profile Overview (UPDATED)
- **63%** are Non-GTF
- **95%** are Non-MBA Pro
- **87%** have Low VaR (<$2,000 USD L12M) — updated from 72% (<$1K) in 3rd draft

### Distribution by VaR Amount and Payout/FYP

| % Payout/FYP | <$2,000 | <$4,000 | ≥$4,000 | Total units |
|--------------|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| FYP = 0, Payout > 0 | 75 | 3 | — | 78 |
| FYP < 0, Payout > 0 | 7 | 1 | — | 8 |
| FYP < 0, Payout < 0 | 6 | — | — | 6 |
| FYP > 0, Payout > 0 | 138 | 12 | 18 | 168 |
| **Total** | **226** | **16** | **18** | **260** |

### VaR Amount Distribution (USD K)

| Segment | <$2,000 | <$4,000 | ≥$4,000 | Total $VaR |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|------------|
| FYP=0, Payout>0 | 28 | 8 | — | 37 |
| FYP<0, Payout>0 | 6 | 4 | — | 11 |
| FYP<0, Payout<0 | 5 | — | — | 4 |
| FYP>0, Payout>0 | 76 | 34 | 130 | 241 |
| **Total** | **117** | **46** | **130** | **293** |

### Key Insights (UPDATED)
- **87% Low-VaR Units** (226 units) have VaR ≤$2K, contributing $117K (40% of total) — acceptable risk level. $2,000/year is not sufficient to encourage gaming behavior
- 34 units with VaR ≥$2K contribute $176K (60% of total) — see deep dive in following slides
- See special cases where FYP = 0 or negative in Slide 8

---

## Slide 6: Units with VaR > 0 & 13-Month Persistency (NEW SLIDE)

### P13 Analysis for 168 Units (FYP > 0 & Payout > 0)

| P13 Group | <$2,000 | <$4,000 | ≥$4,000 | Total |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| P13 ≥ 60% (good quality) | — | — | — | 76 |
| P13 < 60% (lower quality) | 16 | — | — | 16 |
| Not yet P13 (new UM/GTF <12m) | — | — | 5 | 76 |
| **Total** | **138** | **12** | **18** | **168** |

### Summary
1. **76 Units** have good sales quality (13-month persistency ≥ 60%) — low risk
2. **16 Units** have lower 13-month persistency but small VaR (< $2,000 USD) — immaterial risk
3. **76 Units** do not yet have P13 (new UM or GTF under 12 months):
   - 71 Units have small VaR — low risk
   - **Only 5 Units** have VaR ≥ $4,000 USD — see deep dive below

### Deep Dive: 5 Units with No P13 and VaR ≥ $4,000 USD

**Profile:**
- All 5 units are **GTF** (Growth Task Force)
- All 5 are **top UM** (high-risk profile)
- 90% of payout comes from **UMC (31%)** and **GTF Subsidy (57%)**

**Root Cause — Calculation Mismatch (NOT actual risk):**
- VaR is calculated using FYP from **Direct Team** (smaller scope)
- UM+ Compensation (UMC) and GTF Subsidy are calculated using FYP from **Direct Report** (larger scope)
- Average FYP Direct Team: 1.68K USD vs Average FYP Direct Report: 18.99K USD
- This mismatch makes VaR appear high, but the underlying compensation is earned legitimately from a larger team base
- **Conclusion: Not a real risk — driven by technical calculation mismatch between Direct Report and Direct Team definitions**

## Slide 7: Bonus Contribution Breakdown — Units with VaR > 0

### UM+ income dominates VaR exposure (43%)

| Income Component | Amount (K USD) | % of Total |
|-----------------|----------------|------------|
| **Total Payout** | **1,214** | **100%** |
| 1) FYC | 305 | 25% |
| 2) Agent Income | 392 | 32% |
| — Agent Compensation | 192 | 16% |
| — Agent Contest | 107 | 15% |
| 3) UM+ Income | 517 | 43% |
| — UM+ Compensation | 372 | 31% |
| —— Override | 228 | 19% |
| —— Team activation bonus | 125 | 10% |
| —— Other compensation bonuses | 19 | 2% |
| — GTF Subsidy | 45 | 4% |
| — UM+ Contest | 85 | 7% |

### Key Finding
- UM+ compensation — particularly leader overrides ($228K, 19%) and leader activation ($125K, 10%) — is the largest contributor to positive-VaR units
- Arbitrage risk is most likely at UM+ layer where UM+ can influence their unit production

## Slide 8: Performance — Combined GTF & Non-GTF Summary (COMBINED from 3rd draft slides 7 & 8)

### Non-GTF Units (123 units: FYP DT > 0, Payout > 0)

| Key Metric | Value |
|------------|-------|
| Units with %Payout/FYP < 150% | 66% |
| Units with %Payout/FYP > 250% | 4% (mostly low-production, FYP <4K, driven by deferred payment) |
| Non MBA Pro | 94% |
| MBA Pro (Top Leader) | 6% |

### GTF Units (45 units: FYP DT > 0, Payout > 0)

| Key Metric | Value |
|------------|-------|
| Units with %Payout/FYP < 150% | 56% |
| Units with %Payout/FYP > 250% | ~26% (12 units, mostly low-production, driven by non-deferred components) |
| Non MBA Pro | 89% (~40 units) |
| MBA Pro (Top Leader) | 11% (~5 units) |

### Combined Key Findings
- Majority of both GTF and Non-GTF units have acceptable payout/FYP ratios (below 150%)
- High-ratio units are predominantly in low-production groups where small absolute amounts create high percentages
- Top Leader (MBA Pro) representation is minimal in both segments
- No conduct flags identified in either group

---

## Slide 9: Special Cases: Zero-FYP & Negative-FYP Units (UPDATED)

### Profile of Special Cases (UPDATED per feedback)
- **100%** are Non-top UM
- **100%** are Non-MBA
- **50%+** are GTF
- **Majority** have VaR < $2,000 USD — not sufficient to encourage gaming

### FYP = 0 & Payout > 0 (78 units, $36.6K VaR)

| Component | Amount | % | Note |
|-----------|--------|---|------|
| Total VaR / Payout | $36.6K | 100% | |
| FYC | $0.1K | 0% | |
| Agent Income | $19.3K | 53% | |
| — Agent Contest | $15.0K | 41% | Defer payment |
| — Agent_NAB_FT | $3.2K | 9% | Defer payment |
| UM+ Income | $17.1K | 47% | |
| — GTF Subsidy (9 units) | $8.1K | 22% | Based on FYC direct & indirect |
| — Leader Contest | $5.4K | 15% | Defer payment |

### FYP < 0 & Payout > 0 (7 units, $10.9K VaR)

| Component | Amount | % | Note |
|-----------|--------|---|------|
| Total Payout | $5.4K | 100% | |
| FYC (negative) | ($2.0K) | -36% | |
| Agent Income | $4.2K | 77% | |
| — Agent Contest | $3.2K | 59% | Defer payment |
| UM+ Income | $3.2K | 60% | |
| — Leader Contest | $1.8K | 34% | Defer payment |

### FYP < 0 & Payout < 0 (6 units, $4K VaR)
- Minimal exposure; payout negative means net recovery
- No action required

### Root Causes Confirmed
- Defer payment from prior year production is the main driver
- Payout includes override from indirect team while FYP only captures direct team
- Majority have VaR < $2,000 USD — immaterial and not encouraging gaming behavior

## Slide 10: 2026 Compensation Change Impact: Back-Test & Forecast

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 2025 Actual (Old Scheme) | $0.3 mil |
| 2025 Back-Test (New Scheme) | $0.48 mil |
| 2026 Forecast (New Scheme) | $0.85 mil |
| FYP Growth Target | +35% |

### Back-Test 2025 (New compensation scheme on actual performance 2025)

| Segment | Non-MBA | Silver | Gold | Platinum | Total |
|---------|---------|--------|------|----------|-------|
| VaR (K USD) | 378 | 83 | 18 | 2 | 481 |
| # Units VAR>0 | 190 | 6 | 3 | 3 | 202 |
| GTF | 45 | 2 | 1 | — | 48 |
| Non-GTF | 145 | 4 | 2 | 3 | 154 |

### Forecast 2026 (New compensation scheme + Forecast growth 2026 FYP)

| Segment | Non-MBA | Silver | Gold | Platinum | Total |
|---------|---------|--------|------|----------|-------|
| VaR (K USD) | 421 | 224 | 94 | 117 | 856 |
| # Units VAR>0 | 260 | 18 | 15 | 13 | 306 |
| GTF | 108 | 4 | — | — | 112 |
| Non-GTF | 96 | 9 | 7 | 7 | 119 |

### Divergent Trends by Segment
- **Non-MBA Pro VaR +11%** ($378K→$421K): under new scheme, income of non-MBA only slightly increases
- **MBA Pro VaR surges 4.2×** ($103K→$435K): new scheme boosts top-performer MBA UM+ compensation significantly
- **GTF units with VAR>0 increase**: production increase causes some GTF units to jump to higher compensation tiers

---

## Slide 11: $1.5 mil Trigger Point Proposal

### Progression
| State | Value | Context |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Current (2025 Actual) | $0.3M | Historically low due to reduced salesforce, business downturn |
| Expected (2026 Forecast) | $0.85M | Under new compensation scheme with 35% FYP growth |
| Proposed Trigger | $1.5M | Reduced from legacy $3.0M — a 50% tightening |

### Rationale for $1.5M
- **Proactive 50% tightening** from legacy $3.0M threshold
- **Calibrated against 2026 forecast** ($0.85M) under new compensation scheme
- **Supported by structurally cleaner salesforce** following 2024-2025 conduct reviews

### Buffer from $0.85M to $1.5M absorbs:
- **Structural formula asymmetry**: Income from entire team hierarchy vs FYP from direct team only
- **New product ILP**: Higher case size (min premium = 2.5× current) drives higher productivities and compensation rates
- **Normal business fluctuations**: Seasonal patterns, deferred payments, one-off retention packages

### Comprehensive monthly monitoring framework with multi-indicator screening remains in place regardless of threshold level

---

## Slide 12: VAR Monitoring & Control Framework

| Action Item | Owner | Frequency | Timeline |
|-------------|-------|-----------|----------|
| Dashboard Channel VaR report development | ASBD | — | 2025 Q1 |
| Monitor total payout incl. PSM+ for significant fluctuations | ASBD | Monthly | Ongoing |
| Review VaR monitoring tool for enhancement | ASBD | Quarterly | Ongoing |
| Deep-dive payout data: compensation components, agency segments | ASBD | Monthly | From Mar '25 |
| Red-flag investigation: multi-indicator screening | Line1B | Monthly | Already in place |
| Update tracking in Local ARC; escalate to ARC/RCSC when breached | Line1B | Monthly | From Mar '25 |
| Embed VAR impact review in annual compensation review | ASBD | Annual | 2025 Q4 |

### Escalation Protocol When Threshold Is Breached
When monthly VAR exceeds $1.5M, the local Compensation team and Line1B must provide a deep-dive analysis. Line1B already manages monthly protocols for other risk controls — integrated into existing workflows.

---

## Slide 13: Conclusion & Recommendation

| State | Value | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Current State | $0.3M | 2025 actual VAR — historically low. VAR stable at $0.3-0.4M driven by reduced salesforce (CA 13.6K = 1/4-1/5 of prior years), lower FYP, and cleaner teams |
| Expected State | $0.85M | 2026 forecast under new compensation scheme with 35% FYP growth |
| Proposed Trigger | $1.5M | Reduced from legacy $3.0M — a 50% tightening. Provides ~1.76× buffer above forecast |

### Key Conclusions from 2025 Review
- 260 UM units with VAR > 0, total exposure $0.29M — very low and stable
- 87% of units have VAR < $2,000 — not sufficient to encourage gaming behavior
- High-VAR units (5 GTF top UM) driven by calculation mismatch (Direct Report vs Direct Team), not actual risk
- Special cases (zero/negative FYP) driven by defer payment — confirmed non-risk

The $1.5M trigger point represents a proactive 50% tightening from the legacy $3.0M threshold. It is calibrated against the 2026 forecast ($0.85M), supported by a structurally cleaner salesforce following 2024-2025 conduct reviews.

All data as of January 2026
