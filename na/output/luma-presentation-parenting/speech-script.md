# Speech Script — LUMA Coaching Session Presentation

**Total target time: ~6 minutes**

---

## Slide 1 — Title & Introduction (~30 seconds)

> Hi everyone, I'm Tien Phan. Thank you for joining this coaching session.
>
> Today I'd like to share how I applied Design Thinking from the LUMA Practitioner Program to a real-life challenge — not a work project, but something very personal: parenting. I wanted to see if the methods we've been learning could make a real difference in how I approach everyday family life. And I think the results might surprise you.

## Slide 2 — A Few Words About My Challenge (~1 minute 15 seconds)

> So here's my challenge. I have two young daughters — one is four years old and the other is two. They come home from school every day at around 4 PM, Monday through Friday.
>
> The thing is, my wife and I are both at work during that time. A caregiver stays with them at home and is responsible for guiding their afternoon activities — everything from snack time through to when we get home in the evening.
>
> Both girls attend a Steiner — or Waldorf — school, so we wanted after-school activities that complement what they're already learning in the classroom. But the activities also need to be diverse, age-appropriate for each child — because a two-year-old and a four-year-old have very different needs — and, this is the key part, simple enough for the caregiver to follow and instruct on her own, without us being there to explain every step.
>
> We also realized that Steiner alone might not cover every developmental area, so we wanted the flexibility to draw from other educational philosophies like Montessori and Reggio Emilia to fill in the gaps.
>
> That's the challenge I decided to tackle using LUMA methods.

## Slide 3 — Methods Used Overview (~1 minute)

> Let me walk you through my recipe — the LUMA methods I chose and why.
>
> I organized them across the three LUMA categories. Under **Looking** — methods for observing human experience — I used Walk-a-Mile Immersion and Interviewing. These helped me step into the caregiver's shoes and gather real insights from the people closest to my children's daily lives.
>
> Under **Understanding** — methods for analyzing challenges and opportunities — I used Stakeholder Mapping to identify everyone involved and their specific needs, and Rose, Thorn, Bud to evaluate what we'd tried before.
>
> And under **Making** — methods for envisioning future possibilities — I used the Creative Matrix to systematically generate activity ideas across different categories and age groups.
>
> Each method built on the previous one, creating a natural flow from observation to analysis to ideation.

---

## Slide 4 — Approach: Walk-a-Mile Immersion (~1 minute)

> Let me start with the first method. I did a Walk-a-Mile Immersion — I spent a full afternoon shadowing the caregiver to experience the daily routine firsthand, from the moment the children came home from school until bedtime.
>
> My goal was to understand what the caregiver actually faces every day — the time constraints, the children's energy levels at different hours, what materials and space are available, and where things tend to break down.
>
> What I observed was really eye-opening. I saw how the children transition between activities, what captures their attention, and — just as importantly — where they lose interest and things get chaotic. The biggest insight was that the 4:30 to 5:30 PM window is the hardest, because both children need different types of engagement at the same time, and the caregiver is essentially managing two parallel tracks.
>
> This kind of firsthand observation gave me empathy and understanding that I simply wouldn't have gotten from just asking questions.

---

## Slide 5 — Approach: Interviewing (~1 minute)

> Next, I conducted interviews — structured conversations with both the caregiver and the Steiner school teachers.
>
> With the caregiver, I focused on understanding her comfort level with different types of activities, what she finds easy or difficult to lead, and her own observations about each child's preferences and behaviors. One critical insight was that she strongly prefers visual, step-by-step instructions over written paragraphs — this completely changed how I designed the activity cards later.
>
> With the teachers, I learned about the children's classroom activities, their developmental milestones, and what kinds of at-home extensions they'd recommend. They emphasized nature-based and hands-on activities, which aligned well with the Steiner philosophy.
>
> The 4-year-old thrives with creative and imaginative play, while the 2-year-old needs more sensory and motor-skill focused activities. These insights directly shaped the final activity plan — making sure each child gets what she needs developmentally.

## Slide 6 — Approach: Stakeholder Mapping (~50 seconds)

> Then I moved into the Understanding phase with Stakeholder Mapping. I mapped out all four key stakeholder groups: the children themselves as the primary beneficiaries, the caregiver as the daily executor, us parents as the designers and quality overseers, and the school teachers as the educational philosophy guides.
>
> For each stakeholder, I documented their specific needs, constraints, and what success looks like from their perspective. For example, the caregiver needs simplicity and clarity. The children need age-appropriate stimulation. We as parents need peace of mind. And the teachers want to see continuity between school and home.
>
> This mapping revealed something important: the caregiver is the critical success factor. If the activities aren't designed for her to execute confidently, the whole plan falls apart — no matter how educationally sound it is. That realization shifted my entire design approach.

---

## Slide 7 — Approach: Creative Matrix (~50 seconds)

> Finally, I used the Creative Matrix to move from understanding into making. I set up a grid with activity categories as columns — creative play, motor skills, language development, sensory exploration, and nature-based activities — and developmental goals as rows, broken down by age group.
>
> This systematic approach generated over 30 activity ideas across the five categories. I then filtered them down to about 15 core activities per age group, prioritizing ones that the caregiver could lead independently and that didn't require specialized materials.
>
> One bonus discovery: I identified several activities that work for both ages simultaneously — like nature walks with different observation tasks, or art projects with age-appropriate variations. These "shared activities" became the anchors of our weekly plan, especially for that tricky 4:30–5:30 window I mentioned earlier.

## Slide 8 — Outcomes (Detailed) (~1 minute)

> So what came out of this entire process? Four key outcomes.
>
> First, a structured weekly activity plan — Monday through Friday — tailored to each child's age. It's a balanced mix of creative play, motor skills, language, sensory work, and nature activities. And while the activities complement the Steiner philosophy, I also brought in elements from Montessori and Reggio Emilia to ensure well-rounded development.
>
> Second, I created simple, visual instruction cards that the caregiver can follow independently. Each card has step-by-step illustrations, a materials list, and age-specific tips. They're color-coded by activity type so she can grab the right one at a glance. No phone calls to us needed.
>
> Third, we established a weekly feedback loop. The caregiver notes what works and what doesn't each day, and we review and iterate the plan every weekend. This means the system keeps getting better over time.
>
> And fourth — the biggest win — the caregiver now feels genuinely confident running activities on her own. She went from uncertain and dependent to autonomous and empowered. The children are more engaged, there's less screen time, and we as parents have real peace of mind during work hours.

## Slide 9 — Outcomes (Recap & Visuals) (~30 seconds)

> To put it simply, this process transformed our after-school routine from ad-hoc and stressful into something structured and joyful for everyone involved.
>
> The children now look forward to their afternoon activities. The caregiver feels empowered. And as parents, we know our daughters are engaged in meaningful, developmentally appropriate play — even when we can't be there. That's the power of applying Design Thinking to real life.

---

## Slide 10 — Rose, Thorn & Bud Reflection (~1 minute)

> Let me reflect on how it went using the Rose, Thorn, and Bud framework.
>
> **Rose**: Design Thinking made the whole planning process systematic instead of ad-hoc. Stakeholder Mapping made sure I didn't miss anyone's perspective — especially the caregiver's, which turned out to be the most important. The Walk-a-Mile immersion revealed real daily constraints I wouldn't have discovered otherwise. And the caregiver reported that the children are noticeably more engaged and enthusiastic.
>
> **Thorn**: It was time-consuming to prepare the detailed visual instruction cards at first — each one took real effort to design clearly. It was also hard to predict exactly which activities suit a two-year-old versus a four-year-old; some required trial and error. And the caregiver needed a couple of weeks to adjust to the new structured format after years of a more informal approach.
>
> **Bud**: I see real potential to build a reusable activity template library that grows with the children. I'd love to explore co-designing activities with the children themselves as they get older. This approach could easily extend to weekends and holidays. And I think the framework could be shared with other parents in our school community who face similar challenges.
>
> In terms of evaluation: the methods were applied effectively to a real-world scenario, we produced tangible artifacts — the weekly plan and instruction cards — and we shared them with the caregiver and are now sharing the process with all of you.

---

## Slide 11 — Learn More & Close (~30 seconds)

> To wrap up, there are a few things I'd love to explore with you all during this coaching session.
>
> How can I better sequence LUMA methods for personal challenges like this, especially when the "users" are very young children? Are there tips for facilitating co-design sessions with toddlers and preschoolers? How can I create even more lightweight visual artifacts that non-designers can iterate on? And I'm curious — how have any of you applied Design Thinking outside of traditional work contexts?
>
> Thank you! I'm looking forward to your feedback and questions.
