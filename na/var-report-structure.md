## Slide 2: Executive Summary — Key Findings at a Glance

**KPI Cards:**
- Current VAR (2025 Actual): **$0.3M**
- Approved Trigger (Legacy): **$3.0M**
- Forecast VAR 2026: **$1.3M**
- Proposed Trigger Point: **$2.0M**

**Why VAR Was Low in 2025:**
- Conduct reviews and risk assessments cleaned out high-risk teams (policy churning, mass cancellations), leaving a healthier salesforce
- Business downturn: recruitment declined ~60% in H1 2024 vs 2023, reducing bonus qualifiers; high persistency kept FYP strong
- After excluding timing-gap cases (deferred payments, indirect-team payouts), clean VAR ≈ $0.24M

**Why the Threshold Matters:**
- Breaching the threshold triggers a mandatory risk protocol — deep-dive analysis and escalation
- New compensation scheme (2026) increases UM+ income significantly, pushing VAR from $0.3M → ~$1.3M

---

## Slide 3: Methodology — How VAR Is Calculated

**Formula:** VAR = Σ Total Payout (L12M) − Σ Total FYP (L12M)

**Three pillars (3-column layout):**

1. **Rolling 12 Months** — Sum of payout per month over last 12 months. Reflects full sales cycle and mitigates impact of late payments post free-look period (21 days).

2. **Direct Team Scope** — VAR Direct Team of UM = Σ payout L12M − Σ FYP of all FA direct reports & UM. Only counted at months where agent holds UM+ rank.

3. **Agency Aggregation** — Only UM+ with VAR > 0 are counted (negative-VAR teams are zeroed). Agency VAR = Σ all positive direct-team VARs.

**Payout Includes:**
- First Year Commission (FYC) + rider bonus
- Agent compensation (monthly, quarterly, yearly bonuses)
- UM+ compensation (overrides, activation, development)
- Contests, campaigns, financing schemes, benefits
- GTF subsidy payments

**Exclusions:**
- CSV first year (only ~0.4% of FYP due to high allocation charge)
- PSM+ income — monitored separately by local team on monthly basis
- Tax support scheme, cash advance (loan), retirement funds

## Slide 4: Historical Analysis — VAR Trend 5-Year Rolling L12M

**Visual: Line chart** — 6 lines (2020–2025), x-axis = Jan–Dec, y-axis = $ Million USD (0–4.5)

**Data for chart:**

| Month | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 |
|-------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| Jan   | 2.2  | 1.7  | 2.0  | 3.5  | 2.4  | 0.3  |
| Feb   | 2.1  | 1.8  | 2.1  | 3.5  | 2.0  | 0.3  |
| Mar   | 2.0  | 1.8  | 2.1  | 3.5  | 1.7  | 0.3  |
| Apr   | 1.9  | 1.8  | 2.1  | 3.4  | 1.5  | 0.2  |
| May   | 1.9  | 1.7  | 2.3  | 3.8  | 1.3  | 0.2  |
| Jun   | 1.9  | 1.7  | 2.2  | 3.6  | 0.8  | 0.2  |
| Jul   | 1.9  | 1.8  | 2.0  | 3.7  | 0.7  | 0.2  |
| Aug   | 1.8  | 1.8  | 2.4  | 3.6  | 0.7  | 0.2  |
| Sep   | 1.8  | 1.8  | 2.9  | 3.3  | 0.4  | 0.3  |
| Oct   | 1.8  | 1.8  | 3.0  | 3.3  | 0.4  | 0.3  |
| Nov   | 1.8  | 1.9  | 3.2  | 3.4  | 0.4  | 0.3  |
| Dec   | 1.7  | 2.0  | 3.8  | 2.6  | 0.4  | 0.3  |

**Two callout boxes below chart:**

1. **2020–2022: Stable Period (~$1.8–2.0M)** — Mass recruitment era. Agency FYP ~$200M+/year. New agents contributed ~50% of business. VAR remained stable around $2.0M.

2. **2022–2023: Spike to ~$3.5M** — Peak driven by two compounding factors: (1) deferred payments from 2022 peak production year flowing into 2023 payouts, and (2) special retention schemes for PSM/UM/RH that paid income without requiring production. Business also shifted from new agents to core agents with richer compensation. Peak VAR hit $3.8M in Dec 2022.

## Slide 5: Ratio Analysis — VAR as % of Agency FYP

**Visual: Bar chart** — 6 bars (2020–2025), y-axis = %VAR/Agency FYP

**Data for chart:** 2020: 1.0% | 2021: 0.7% | 2022: 1.2% | 2023: 2.7% | 2024: 1.8% | 2025: 0.5%

**Summary table:**

| Year | Agency FYP (USD M) | Avg VAR (USD M) | Avg %VAR/FYP | Peak %VAR/FYP |
|------|--------------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------|
| 2020 | 222                | 1.9             | 1.0%         | 1.3% (Jan)    |
| 2021 | 241                | 1.8             | 0.7%         | 0.8% (Dec)    |
| 2022 | 204                | 2.5             | 1.2%         | 1.9% (Dec)    |
| 2023 | 72                 | 3.5             | 2.7%         | 4.0% (Nov)    |
| 2024 | 45                 | 1.1             | 1.8%         | 3.6% (Jan)    |
| **2025** | **~55**        | **0.3**         | **0.5%**     | **0.6%**      |

*2025 FYP estimated. 2026 FYP target: 1,787 bn VND (~$71M USD).*

**Key Insight:** 2023 was the outlier year — VAR/FYP peaked at 4.0% when business volume collapsed to $72M (from $204M in 2022) while compensation structures remained unchanged. The 2025 ratio of 0.5% is the lowest in 6 years.

## Slide 6: Deep Dive — Deconstructing the $0.3M

**KPI Cards:**
- Total VAR (Gross): **$0.3M**
- Timing-Gap Cases: **$0.05M**
- Clean VAR (Net): **$0.24M**
- Units with VAR > 0: **260**

**Three cards (3-column layout):**

1. **Deferred Payments ($0.05M)** — NAB and MLY agent payments from late-2024 production paid in early 2025. Contest payouts also lag past the 21-day free-look period. These create artificial VAR without fraud signal.

2. **Reduced Manpower** — H1 2024 recruitment declined ~60% vs 2023. Fewer bonus qualifiers = fewer agents generating positive VAR. Total units with VAR > 0 dropped to 260.

3. **High Persistency** — Unusually high policy renewal rates in 2025 kept FYP revenue strong. Fewer cancellations meant the denominator of the risk equation held up, suppressing VAR.

**Warning callout:** The $0.3M figure reflects favorable market conditions, not a structural reduction in risk exposure. With 2026 targeting 30%+ FYP growth and a new compensation scheme that significantly increases UM+ income, VAR is expected to revert upward. The back-test of 2025 data under the new scheme already shows VAR tripling to ~$1.0M.

## Slide 7: Composition Analysis — Bonus Contribution Breakdown (Units with VAR > 0)

**Visual: Donut chart** — payout composition

**Data for chart/table:**

| Component              | Amount (USD K) | % of Total |
|------------------------|----------------|------------|
| **Total Payout**       | 1,214          | 100%       |
| 1) FYC                 | 305            | 25%        |
| 2) Agent Income        | 392            | 32%        |
|    Agent Compensation   | 192            | 16%        |
|    Agent Contest        | 107+           | ~15%       |
| **3) UM+ Income**      | **517**        | **43%**    |
|    UM+ Compensation     | 372            | 31%        |
|    GTF Subsidy          | ~45            | ~4%        |
|    UM+ Contest           | 85             | 7%         |

**Key Finding:** UM+ Income dominates VAR exposure (43%). Manager-level compensation — particularly leader overrides ($225K, 19%) and leader activation ($125K, 10%) — is the largest contributor. Arbitrage risk is most likely at the UM+ layer where managers can influence their sub-tree's production patterns.

## Slide 8: Risk Segments — Zero-FYP & Negative-FYP Units

**Two-column layout:**

**Left: FYP = 0 & Payout > 0 (8 units, $36.6K VAR)**

| Component       | Amount  | %    |
|-----------------|---------|------|
| Total VAR/Payout| $36.6K  | 100% |
| FYC             | $0.1K   | 0%   |
| Agent Income    | $19.3K  | 53%  |
|   Agent Contest | $15.0K  | 41%  |
| UM+ Income      | $17.1K  | 47%  |
|   **GTF Subsidy** | **$8.1K** | **22%** |

**Right: FYP < 0 & Payout > 0 (7 units, $10.9K VAR)**

| Component       | Amount  | %    |
|-----------------|---------|------|
| Total VAR       | $10.9K  | —    |
| Total Payout    | $5.4K   | 100% |
| FYC (negative)  | ($2.0K) | -36% |
| Agent Income    | $4.2K   | 77%  |
|   Agent Contest | $3.2K   | 59%  |
| UM+ Income      | $3.2K   | 60%  |

**Warning callout — GTF Subsidy: Risk Component — With Claw-Back:**
- GTF subsidy accounts for 22% of VAR in zero-FYP units ($8.1K of $36.6K)
- Calculated on net production — does not require passing the free-look period
- Claw-back mechanism exists: if a GTF terminates within 12–18 months, they must repay the full subsidy received
- Residual risk: submit-cancel-resubmit loops can still generate recurring bonus within the claw-back window if the GTF remains active

## Slide 9: Forward-Looking — 2026 Compensation Impact: Back-Test & Forecast

**KPI Cards:**
- 2025 Actual (Old Scheme): **$0.3M**
- 2025 Back-Test (New Scheme): **$1.05M**
- 2026 Forecast (New Scheme): **$1.29M**
- FYP Growth Target: **+35%**

**Two-column layout with tables:**

**Left: Back-Test 2025 (New Scheme on Actual Data)**

| Segment         | Non-MBA | Silver | Gold | Platinum | Total |
|-----------------|---------|--------|------|----------|-------|
| VAR (USD K)     | 860     | 138    | 31   | 21       | 1,049 |
| # Units VAR>0   | 374     | 11     | 3    | 3        | 391   |
|   GTF           | 102     | 2      | 1    | —        | 105   |
|   Non-GTF       | 272     | 9      | 2    | 3        | 286   |

**Right: Forecast 2026 (New Scheme + Growth)**

| Segment         | Non-MBA | Silver | Gold | Platinum | Total |
|-----------------|---------|--------|------|----------|-------|
| VAR (USD K)     | 694     | 284    | 142  | 172      | 1,292 |
| # Units VAR>0   | 260     | 18     | 15   | 13       | 306   |
|   GTF           | 119     | —      | 4    | 1        | 124   |
|   Non-GTF       | 141     | 14     | 15   | 12       | 182   |

**Divergent Trends by Segment:**
- **Non-MBA Pro VAR drops 19%** ($860K → $694K): new scheme only increases their income ~3% while FYP grows 35% → VAR/FYP ratio improves
- **MBA Pro VAR surges 3.2×** ($190K → $598K): new scheme significantly boosts top-performer compensation
- **GTF units with VAR>0 increase 18%** (105 → 124) despite total units declining 22% — anomaly under investigation

## Slide 10: Calibration Challenges — Why the Threshold Number Is Noisy

**Three cards (3-column layout):**

1. **Deferred Payouts** — Commissions paid on a lag (sometimes >1 year) mean this year's VAR partially reflects last year's sales. The payout schedule artificially lowers VAR in the current year but raises it the next. The number doesn't cleanly map to a single performance period.

2. **One-Off Retention Packages** — A single $500K–$1M talent retention payment to a key agent can spike individual VAR without any fraud signal. These are known, approved expenses — but they inflate aggregate VAR. VAR is designed for mass monitoring, not capturing these one-off decisions.

3. **Revenue Growth Paradox** — Strong revenue growth pushes VAR up because top-performers perform even better and new recruits come in large quantity. High VAR can reflect genuine commercial momentum, not just risk. The 2026 growth target of +35% FYP will mechanically increase VAR.

**Formula Mismatch: Income vs. FYP Scope**
A structural asymmetry exists in the VAR formula: Income includes earnings from the entire team hierarchy (overrides on indirect downlines), but FYP only captures direct-team production. This means a UM+ with a large indirect team can show positive VAR even when the broader team is profitable.

---

## Slide 11: Proposal — Proposed Threshold: $2.0M Trigger Point

**Large centered number: $2.0M**
Recommended Trigger Point | Reduced from legacy $3.0M

**Left column — Rationale for $2.0M:**
- **Tighter than legacy:** Reduces the trigger from $3.0M to $2.0M — a 33% reduction demonstrating proactive risk tightening
- **Sufficient buffer:** 2026 forecast VAR is $1.29M — the $2.0M threshold provides a 1.55× buffer, enough to absorb normal monthly fluctuations without false triggers
- **Compensation scheme impact absorbed:** New scheme triples VAR from $0.3M to ~$1.0M on same production. Even with 35% FYP growth, forecast stays well below $2.0M
- **Cleaner salesforce:** Conduct reviews and high-risk team removals in 2024–2025 structurally reduced risk exposure, justifying a lower threshold than the 2023 peak era
- **2023 peak was anomalous:** The $3.5M peak was driven by deferred payments from 2022 production + one-off retention schemes — conditions that no longer apply

**Right column — Scenario Analysis:**

| Scenario                     | Est. VAR | Triggers? |
|------------------------------|----------|-----------|
| Base case (2026 forecast)    | $1.3M    | ✗ No      |
| +50% stress on forecast      | $1.9M    | ✗ No      |
| Return to 2023 levels        | $3.5M    | ✓ Yes     |
| One-off retention ($0.5M)    | $1.8M    | ✗ No      |
| Recruitment surge + abuse    | $2.0M+   | ✓ Yes     |

**Callout — Threshold Positioning:** The $2.0M trigger is a 33% reduction from the legacy $3.0M — demonstrating tighter controls while providing sufficient headroom above the $1.3M forecast to avoid false-alarm protocol activations from normal business growth.

## Slide 12: Governance — VAR Monitoring & Control Framework

**Table:**

| Action Item | Owner | Frequency | Timeline |
|-------------|-------|-----------|----------|
| Dashboard Channel VaR report development | ASBD | — | 2025 Q1 |
| Monitor total payout incl. PSM+ for significant fluctuations; coordinate with Line1B | ASBD | Monthly | Ongoing |
| Review VaR monitoring tool for enhancement | ASBD | Quarterly | Ongoing |
| Deep-dive payout data: compensation components, agency segments (new agents, top-tier, industrial hire) | ASBD | Monthly | From Mar '25 |
| Red-flag investigation at Location/Unit/Agent level using multi-indicator screening (persistency, sale patterns, phone/bank sharing, welcome call rates, signature forgery, undeclared relatives) | Line1B | Monthly | Already in place |
| Update tracking in Local Agency Risk Committee; escalate to ARC/RCSC when threshold breached | Line1B | Monthly | From Mar '25 |
| Embed VAR impact review in annual compensation review | ASBD | Annual | 2025 Q4 |

**Callout — Escalation Protocol When Threshold Is Breached:** When monthly VAR exceeds $2.0M, the local Compensation team and Line1B (front risk sales) must provide a deep-dive analysis. Line1B already manages monthly protocols for other risk controls — this is integrated into existing workflows, not a new standalone process.

---

## Slide 13: Open Items — Outstanding Questions & Risk Considerations

**Left column — Unresolved Questions:**

1. **GTF Unit Anomaly** — GTF units with VAR > 0 increase 18% (105 → 124) in 2026 forecast despite total units declining 22%. GTF compensation scheme is unchanged and FYP grows 35% — logically VAR/FYP should decrease. Root cause under investigation: possible tier-jump effects or team-size changes.

2. **GTF Subsidy Abuse Risk** — GTF subsidy has no claw-back mechanism and is calculated on net production (no free-look requirement). Submit-cancel-resubmit loops can generate recurring bonus without genuine sales. Should this risk be explicitly addressed in the proposal?

3. **MBA Pro Concentration** — MBA Pro VAR surges 3.2× under new scheme. Is the increased exposure to top-performer compensation acceptable given the business growth objectives?

**Right column — Risk Mitigation Already in Place:**
- Monthly bi-conduct screening: compensation payout ratios cross-referenced with other risk indicators
- Payment suspension authority: high-risk cases can have compensation suspended pending investigation
- Claw-back clauses: high-reward scheme agreements include claw-back provisions
- Campaign enrollment suspension: violating agents/UMs can be blocked from big campaigns
- Contract termination: ultimate sanction for confirmed fraud cases

**Recommended Next Steps:**
- Complete deep-dive on 119 non-MBA GTF units to explain the anomalous increase
- Quantify GTF subsidy contribution to total VAR exposure
- Validate 30%+ FYP growth assumption underlying the forecast
- Assess whether GTF subsidy claw-back mechanism should be introduced

## Slide 14: Conclusion & Recommendation

**Three-panel layout (dark background):**

| Current State | Expected State | Proposed Trigger |
|---------------|----------------|------------------|
| **$0.3M** | **$1.3M** | **$2.0M** |
| 2025 actual VAR — historically low due to high persistency, reduced manpower, and business downtrend. This is a good-year artifact, not structural improvement. | 2026 forecast under new compensation scheme with 35% FYP growth. New scheme triples VAR on same production; growth adds further upward pressure. | Reduced from legacy $3.0M — a 33% tightening. Provides 1.55× buffer above forecast. Reflects cleaner salesforce post-conduct reviews. Catches genuine risk events while avoiding false triggers. |

**Summary statement:** The $2.0M trigger point represents a proactive 33% tightening from the legacy $3.0M threshold, demonstrating strengthened risk controls. It is calibrated against the 2026 forecast ($1.29M), stress-tested under the new compensation scheme, and supported by a structurally cleaner salesforce following 2024–2025 conduct reviews. The comprehensive monthly monitoring framework with multi-indicator screening remains in place regardless of threshold level.
