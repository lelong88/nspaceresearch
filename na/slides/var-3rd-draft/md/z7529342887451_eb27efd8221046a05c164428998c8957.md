## Three-Column Comparison

| **Current State** | **Expected State** | **Proposed Trigger** |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **$0.29 mil** | **$0.85M** | **$1.5M** |
| 2025 forecast VAR under old compensation scheme (legacy $3.0Mn threshold) | 2025 forecast under new compensation scheme and strengthened salesforce following 2024-2025 conduct reviews (old threshold) | Budget trigger level, $3.0M → $1.5M tightening |

## 2026 VaR threshold rationale

• **$1.5M** trigger point represents a proactive 50% tightening from the legacy $3.0Mn threshold, demonstrating tightening signal and strengthened risk controls.

• It is calibrated against the 2026 forecast ($0.85Mn) under the new compensation scheme, and supported by a structurally cleaner salesforce following 2024-2025 conduct reviews.

• The buffer from **$0.85Mn** to $1.5Mn to absorb:

  ➢ A structural asymmetry exists in the VaR formula: Income includes earnings from the entire team hierarchy, but FYP only captures direct team production (exclude UM+ in direct team). This means a UM+ with a large indirect team or with many high-productive UM+ in direct report can show positive VAR even without any risk—because their income reflects a wider scope than the FYP offset.

  ➢ New product ILP → higher case size (min premium = 2.5x current case size), this can drive productivities for certain producers and their leaders subsequently, expect xx% fyp contribution hence xx% increase in average productivities... compensation structure such that the higher the productivity the higher the rate, hence we may expect increase VaR...

• The comprehensive monthly monitoring framework with multi-indicator screening remains in place regardless of threshold level *(details in slide 9)*.
