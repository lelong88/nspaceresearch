![Source](../images/z7529335605713_3ab1d8801ac2574a8ca193121084bebf.jpg)

**82 units (all are non-PEA, 51/82 are GTF) with special VaR where production is 0 or negative but payout is positive, this due to:**

- Majority driven by timing gaps between payment and period that production occur (e.g., deferred payment of previously earned retention bonuses).
- Payout includes income generated from indirect team while FYP captures only direct team production
- Majority of units (82 out of 92) have total VaR rating 12 months amount <2,000 USD which is immaterial.
