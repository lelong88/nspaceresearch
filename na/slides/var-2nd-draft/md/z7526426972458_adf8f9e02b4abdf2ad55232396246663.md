## GTF Subsidy: Risk Component — With clawback

- GTF subsidy = 22% of VaR in zero-FYP units ($8.1K of $36.6K)
- GTF subsidy calculated on net production — does not require passing free-look period
- Claw-back mechanism exists: if GTF terminates within 12–18 months, must repay subsidy received in first 6 months.
