### 2020-2022: Stable Period (VaR ~$1.8-2.0M):
- Mass agent recruitment ~50k-60k new recruits/year with tremendous leader (UM+) manpower
- Agency FYP ~$200+ mil/year, in which **new agents (MO-M12) accounted for ~50% of business while FYP contribution from top agent cohort is ~30%**

### ▲ 2022-2023: Spike to ~$3.8M, driven by:
- Deferred payment from 2022 peak production flowing into 2023
- VaR peak $3.8M in Dec 2022

*Bar chart showing Avg %VaR/FYP by year: 2020 (~1.0%), 2021 (~0.7%), 2022 (~1.1%), 2023 (~2.6%), 2024 (~1.6%), 2025 (~0.3%)*

### VaR as % of Agency FYP:
- 2023 was the outlier year — VaR/FYP peaked at 4.0% when business volume collapsed to $72Mn (from $204 mil in 2022) while compensation structures remained unchanged.
- The 2025 ratio of avg. 0.4% is the lowest in 6 years, driven by improved persistency and reduced manpower.
