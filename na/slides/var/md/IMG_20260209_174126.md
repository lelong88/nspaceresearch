- Over the last 2 years, MVL business has experienced significant changes in our business model compared to period of 2019 – 2022 due to market's structural changes & challenges. Therefore, the VaR amount also demonstrated varying trends over last 5 years.

- From 2019 to 2022, MVL capitalized on mass recruitment trends of VN market and reached business volume at around 200mil USD/ year with APE contribution of MO-12 agents was consistently above 50%. During this period, **$VaR amount remained stable ~2.0mil USD**.

- From late 2022 to 2023, APE started to drop largely with significant decline in recruitment, Agency business contribution have been gradually switching from new agents to core agents while compensation designed have been more favorable for higher performers. As a result, we observed **$VaR amount increased to ~3.5mil USD in 2023**.

- In 2024, VaR experienced downward trends with lower number of bonus qualifiers due to:
  - Reduced manpower resulting from continued decreases in recruitment (2024H1 recruitment declined by ~60% vs. 2023)
  - Continued business downtrend due to the aftermath of tighten regulation, macro economy condition, competitor poaching & customers' trusts after media crisis

- For 2025, with business plan targeting ~7mil USD, we expect to return to same production, activity and recruitment level with 2023. With anticipated business growth next year, we'd expect to share **similar VaR exposures with 2023**.

- Additionally in Apr'2024, we've launched new compensation aimed at optimizing PREs to increase and invest more in UM compensation, however with the current challenging business circumstances it will take time for UM+ to rebuild their team and qualify for the increased benefits. As such the 2024 VaR not yet reflect the impact of this increased investment.

➢ Therefore, we're proposing benchmark with average 2023 VaR at **$3.5mil USD** and trigger point at **$3.0mil USD**.
