*[Organizational diagram showing hierarchical structure with colored circles representing different manager teams and their relationships]*

**Structure:**
- Top: "DIRECT TEAM of manager A"
- Center: BM (A) [blue circle] with FA 1 [beige circle] to the right
- Left branch: "Direct team of manager B" → SDM (B) [blue circle] → UM (D) [brown circle] → FA 4 [gray box], FA 2 [gray box]
- Right branch: "Direct team of manager C" → BM (C) [red circle] → SUM (E) [blue circle] → FA 5 [green box], FA 6 [green box]
- Center bottom: FA 3 [gray box] connecting BM (A) and SUM (E)

## Definitions

➢ **Direct team of:**
- BM A = BM A + FA 1
- SUM E = SUM E + FA 5 + FA 6

➢ **Direct team income L12M of:**
- BM A = total payout last 12 months to BM A *(include his personal & all income based on his whole team)* + payout to his direct team FA 1
- .....

➢ **Direct team FYP L12M of:**
- BM A = FYP produced last 12 months by BM A + FA 1
- SUM E = FYP produced last 12 months by SUM E + FA 5 + FA 6

➢ **VaR of team A/B/C/D/E** = Direct team income L12M of each team – FYP L12M of each team

*(Assume VaR Direct team A <0)*

➢ **Agency VaR = ∑Sum of VaR direct team B, C, D, E**

➢ *Note: Income used for calculation include all income of a Manager (which based on their whole team production and already include overrides on those indirect downlines) but minus only their direct team FYP*
