## 1. AGENCY EXPENSES:

### For 46 current offices

| Year | Avg. 2023-2024 | 2025 | **For 20 planned MAC<br>Total 3 years** |
|------|----------------|------|----------------------------------------|
| FYP (mil USD) | 62 | 66 | 11 |
| Office cost (mil USD) | 12.4 | 10.4 | 1.4 |
| **Office cost/FYP** | **20%** | **16%** | **13%** |
| **Existing allowable PREs for Agency** | | **66%** | **58%** |

**Key bullets:**
- For existing 46 branch offices, our sales is generated with **66% FYP PREs** and approximately **~20% FYP** for office operation costs (exclude. CAPEX) in last 2 years and estimated to be at **~16% FYP for 2025**.
- For 20 MAC offices, we'd have the same expenses for **PREs** but instead of spending on fixed costs for set-up, operate and maintain the office ourselves, we will subsidize SM partially with performance-tied office allowance at **~13% FYP for first 3 years and 8% FYP onwards** and shift office operation burden to sales managers with some company oversights

## 2. COSTS SENSITIVITY

For recruitment plan of 20 MACs in 2025, in all scenarios, MAC office subsidy is estimated between 1.2 – 1.4 mil USD, at approximately 12%-14% of FYP (inclusive of MAC office set-up subsidy) which is lower than a typical existing branch office operation costs (around 16%-20% of FYP excluding CAPEX).
