# Executive Summary

*(Slide 3 — Highly Confidential)*

![Source](../images/1.jpg)

1) Over the past two years, our top priority has been to strengthen our presence in markets where we already have a solid foundation, such as Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, and Hai Phong, while also enhancing our position in key areas like Da Nang, Nghe An, and Thanh Hoa. To achieve this, we have focused on optimizing and renovating offices to enhance our brand presence in these cities and will continue with these initiatives.

2) To meet our growth ambition, we must implement an effective channel expansion strategy.

3) Currently, our sales contribution is geographically concentrated, with **43 Agency offices** in **36 out of 63 provinces** and **85% of our new business coming from top 10** contributing provinces. Therefore, we need to expand our footprint beyond these cities through an inorganic growth strategy.

4) While the MVL branch office model is effective in attracting agents in major cities, it may not be sustainable or efficient in smaller markets.

5) Given that our key competitors primarily operate in franchise-model, we need to find a way to attract leaders from this model while capitalizing on our existing branch model and agency structure to minimize any internal conflict and opposition. This necessitates **a hybrid approach.**

## MAC (Manulife Agency Center)

- MAC (Manulife Agency Center) is a small sales offices set up by SM+ in untapped/underserved location distant from MVL branch, in exchange they are compensated with a combination of fixed and variable bonus that tied to their production levels and office costs are partially subsidized by MVL:
  - This leverages sales leaders' entrepreneurial mindset while also provided a higher financial security for them as opposed to fully franchise-model.
  - This helps solving existing challenges from Branch model by shifting office operation to sales managers with some company oversights through partial costs subsidy mechanism.
- We have implemented this one with step-by-step approach to minimize execution risks, hence first to pilot recruitment in Apr'25 and to review the scheme for on-going implementation approval.
