# Compensation Arbitrage Risk Assessment

![Source](../images/16.jpg)

## Expected Change is CAR Exposure

• Arbitrage risks (post-tax) are projected to be **-128.3% to 134.1%** post-tax; an increase from 1.3% (Normal) to 17.3% (Top Tier); the additional risk exposure comes from:

  • UM compensation scheme increase from 2.49% (Normal) – 6.4% (High) - 13.1% (MDRT) and up to 16.1% (Top Tier)
  
  • Add-in Customer promotion (under Cash value category from 1.5% Top Tier to 6.0% Normal)
  
  • Campaign pre-tax increases from 0.8% (MDRT+) to 3.1% (Top Tier) but decreases for Normal and High Scenarios offsetting for the increase in Customer campaigns & UM compensation

• The projected CAR increase is driven by strategic investment in a small, high-performing group and based on scenarios that are highly unlikely to materialize at scale:

  • Increase investment in proven leaders: The increase is largely due to higher bonus rate for MBA Pro Top Leaders - a group of ~200 individuals with strong track records, long tenure, and consistently high P13 performance.
  
  • Highly challenging scenarios: The assumptions behind MDRT+ and Top Tier scenarios are extremely demanding. They require 6 or 8 producers in their team per month to perform at same MDRT+ level each month to qualify for the highest bonus rate. Currently, we only have about 20 cases that meet 3 out 5 key assumptions for scenarios Normal and no UM+ meets the assumptions as outlined in MDRT and Top Tier scenarios.

• In addition, we have implemented control measures across bonus and sales hierarchies to mitigate arbitrage risk. These include applying P13, post-ireetook applied to all campaigns and significant amount schemes; claw back clauses for early agent and policy termination, caps on maximum exposure, and withholding mechanisms for high bonus amounts. This year we will increase the P13 threshold to further reinforce quality. Additionally, regular monitoring will be conducted and investigation in suspicious cases as well as ultimately suspension of compensation payment if needed *(see next slide for details on mitigation actions)*.
