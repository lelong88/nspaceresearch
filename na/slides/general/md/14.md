## Summary

• Agency BAU PREs include Compensation for Agents, UM+, PSM+ and GTF financing scheme and other benefits, campaigns, conference, activities support,...) but not include Agent's commission

• Best estimated of Agency PREs is ~58% FYP within allowable expenses.

• Projected FYP is based on VN Agency plan of 71.5mil USD and assume 33% YoY Growth for 2026 and 25% Growth YoY for 2027-2028.

• The schemes are mostly variable in nature, linking everything to the level of FYC/FYP produced. In later years, when the sales force has increases productivity leading to variable income generate higher percentages, this will be compensated by lower percentage from fixed or capped bonus component, thus leading to quite stable over subsequent years.
