Later. So, the last character of the GTF MAC, they will have two roles: one as a SM GTF, a normal like a sales manager, and they also enjoy the normal sales manager conversation. And the second role is someone who manages the sales offices, which they receive the MAC scheme. So, for the MAC, we have piloted some of the recruitment and piloted the scheme in 2025. So far, we are able to have eight MAC open, and we have another eight is onboarding. Onboarding meaning they are still registering for the—and they need to register for a company, like register with the government to open a company, a limited company. And then they are in the progress to find the location, and we are checking and verifying the location with them. So, eight of them are onboarding, and eight of them are already open. We have seven open already, but one is opening soon. And so, yeah. For the pages now, just to get a sense, right, for those onboarding ones, do you have an estimated timeline? Like, when will this take more to open? We do have some details, but I will have to check up with the PM for the whole program because it's relating to the progress of the location checking that they're working on case by case. But let me check with them, and let me check with them the timeline and get back to you when they are expecting this. So, normally, I think it also kind of takes time. Yeah. Okay. I mean, good to get a clarity like, "Oh, by H1, we'll have four more." I mean, just a sense about because to me, if this is open, it's like double, right? But I don't know when it's happening. So, I mean, good to have a sense also. So, maybe I ask one more question on your previous page from—do you have any requirements when you hire these SM GTF MAC? Do you have an explicit kind of qualification? The question I'm asking is, it becomes quite critical when we take the learnings from Indonesia GA, right? Some of them later, we think, "Oh, we may not be doing enough or strict kind of onboard." I mean, selection. So, that's why I'm asking, do you have that requirement? Yeah, we do. We do. So, for the MAC, first, we would have the recruitment requirement to recruit them as an external SM. So, the recruitment criteria would be based on the FYP number, their last 12-month number of manpower they have, number of income, and P13 if we're able to have approved. We require about two years, at least two years' experience in life insurance. That was for the normal SM GTF. And then for the GTF MAC, we would have an additional income of the credit check and the reference check when possible. And also, for the onboarding interview, so they will go through the normal SM GTF interview, which is normally would have one round of official interview with Manulife here. But for the MAC, they will go through a second interview with the MAC committee, which includes our CAO, our head strategy, MBA Dung, and La Wan Bi. And compliance is welcome to join if they have the time. Yeah. Yeah. So, basically, they just need, I mean, just work experience-wise, it's two years. Two years. Yeah. No matter what grade they need to be. Oh, no. They don't need to be. So, no, no. We would also look at what is the rank because throughout our interview, so we ask them about the rank. And these two years, meaning two years in the sales manager role. So, like a role where they need to—so it's similar to like an AD staff in a GA franchise, or it can be another SM in the branch office, company. So, what we do is, in detail, we do have a reference. We try to map out the structure of each company into a table. And so we can benchmark when someone's telling us that they are a DM from company X, we can have a drafting sense of what is their size based on the memo of the MOC and promotion. And so we reference back and forth. Okay. So, you have a hierarchy reference. But I mean, I think it would be good if you elaborate more on that slide, on this slide, so that people when reaching out, so people ask you, you can have like you just put number, right? You can put two years on senior head. Yeah, I do. What about education and age? What are your requirements now? Education is college and above. Age is 25 to—let me check. Maybe one step back is how does it come up? Is it from industry reference, or how do you come up with all these criteria? Oh, well, because I think all the—you mean why we choose these criteria, right? Yeah. For example, even the education, you say college above, right? Then I'll ask, "Oh, why not Diploma?" For example, right? Just make it—but just to check what is the thinking process when you put up these criteria. Is this from industry practice, or what is the thinking behind? Yeah. It's industry practice. For example, from the industry practice, if you wanted to become in the agent insurance industry, normally they don't require any degrees or anything. But for some of the—for most of the, for example, like full-time scheme, full-time additional allowance, and full-time program, full-time scheme, they would require college and above. Yeah. So these are like very kind of common norms in the agency. So it's just like a basic requirement that we will put here. But specifically for the GTF SM, our GTF SM, this actually set of criteria has been running for quite a long time. Because this scheme, the organic recruitment scheme in Manulife Vietnam has been running for quite a long time. So it's just kind of long ago. And the MAC, as you say, if they are GTF MAC, basically, I mean, SM GTF MAC, basically it's just two more rounds of checks. Yeah. It's two more rounds. Okay. So same criteria and more interviews. Okay. Yeah. More interview. And so I think I will try to be more detailed in this one in terms of the slide updating. But so what they do is, after they're passing the GTF recruitment interview, they will be proceed to the MAC interview. And then they will need to submit a business plan, like a simple business plan. And then during the interview, they will be interviewed by our committee. And then after the interview, the committee will sit down together to vote on whether we proceed with the offer. After they proceed with the offer, then our bank office will go on and require them to submit all the documents for the reference check in terms of the credit and reference checking. Yeah. Okay. I mean, I understand the background for now first in case I have other questions on this pilot that you do. But at least it's something that we have and maybe just give some more colors and we study further. Okay? From Pleiku I have to your page. Sorry. Just a quick one. You mentioned that it—I mean, it's open currently. Yeah. Yeah. Do you have those numbers or how they are performing and stuff? Oh, the performance? Yeah. So just now we have graphed the performance. So we have eight of them. Together, they produce about 5.8 billion Dong for the past few months. I would say roughly about only 1% of the total Vietnam agency, which is quite small because they are just starting the beginning. But in terms of the total GDF, like external leader that we recruited in, they accounted for about 20% of the FYP. So I think compared to our normal recruitment, I think it looks promising. Yeah. I think one thing that could give a bit more color is if we can compare, let's say, the size of these agencies. I'm guessing some of these agencies have got a certain size and whether, I mean, I guess when we recruit them, we have some expectation, right? So for example, if you're coming from a certain team, we expect you to do X amount. Can we see that comparison or benchmarking so that—I mean, I know it's incremental scoping anyway, but the idea is that I guess in terms of tracking, at least we give comfort to the still go that our expectation to actual is not too far so that for future tracking as well, they know that if Phuong is saying they're going to do like 10 million or 10 billion, they'll do 10 billion kind of thing. You know what I mean? So that's one. And then the other thing is, is there a total cost that we have figured out so far as well so that we can sort of see some value of return? Which I think will just help your case. I think ultimately what we're trying to do is make this proposal—I mean, if it works, then it works and works well. And one more thing to consider is maybe quality measure. If you can put a quality measure here in terms of what this group quality looks like of retention of agents, retention of case policies, for example. I know it's a bit early, but something like that, then I think Steelcow will be very accepting of a new scheme that is piloted, which is good, and got some results that is tangible. And even if the results are bad, it's okay, right? I think the idea is to go to the Steelcow with transparency and to tell them, "Hey, this is what happened. This is what we saw. This is what we're going to change because we want to improve certain parts of it." And so I think that comfort will make this proposal very easy to go ahead because you have a record of doing it before. Yeah. I think now this page you are spot on. I think this page is a bit hard to say or comment anything. So even maybe Phuong can prepare a breakdown version for at least Rishi and us internally just to see, right? Because like Rishi mentioned, he actually never sees any updates in terms of the performance. So I don't mind you prepare a deeper breakdown, even by branch, like the best branch is doing X and maybe it's compared to competitors, is it good or bad? And then like Max Point, if we give them some validation package, what are their validation ratio percentage look like? Or the team size, how does it go, right? That kind of thing would be helpful for us to also visualize a bit more. Yeah. So let me just cut on. Okay. So I can do what we need to do is, apart from the FYP, say how much is they achieving their target in total so that we have a sense of whether they meet the target that we set for them. Also, a summary in terms of the cost that we've been paying for MAC so that we can see if it's still in progress as we planned in our original proposal. And also break down by the number of branches so that we can see which one is doing good, which one is not. Okay. So that's the three things that we can update further. Okay. Got it. Yeah. I mean, I'll say that the focus is just on this type, to be honest. I mean, whatever proposal you have later on, I honestly will be fine if you tell me that you're running this for one year or six months. I mean, to me, the pilot makes a lot of sense because you have record and actual results. The projections to me is just numbers, right? We are so clever at creating numbers, so I'm not worried about the projections. I actually want to see what the actual business outcomes are. And then that will give us a lot of security. I think if it's running well, it's running well, right? Then worst-case number is still okay to put a cap. And then once you put a cap on it, you guys can run within the cap, something like that, right? So yeah, I think that's where I'm coming from. I don't know. Yeah. Also, just one thing I also want to ask you. In terms of the sales quality, it's quite early. So basically, we have eight of them, right? But I think let me check. I think two, three of them only started in October, November, and December. And then majority of them started in Q3. So how do you think? No, it's fine. I mean, I think my point is that it's to illustrate that you also have a tracking. I think that's the point that we want to tell members, right? We tell members that, "Hey, well, we have tracking of all this as a group, but at the same time, we also have the granularity of each MAC and what they are performing." Because I think, again, for markets like Vietnam and all, what they are looking for is making sure that the quality is high, essentially. And quality is high, I think no one's going to tell you not to do it, right? If quality is good in your market, please go ahead and do it. So I think that will give some comfort to the members that, "Hey, Vietnam team is on top of just sales and performance. That's Susan and Rishi's goals." But even then, Susan and Rishi's goals also have quality. So to me, quality has to be somewhere. And it might not come up yet, but at least you can talk about tracking and talk about what you're doing to ensure quality is good. And whenever, let's say, if quality is not good, what actions have been taken, for example? I think that itself shows that robustness in terms of the proposal, right? It's not just, "Hey, I'm here to just throw some money and take whoever I want to close sales." I mean, that's not the point. The point is to have some guardrails and sort of do it as a proper structured scheme. And then that's the differentiation between MAS, right? This is talking about a different level. Okay. Let me think it through and see what we can show. Because honestly, I think so in the past few months, we've been setting up, and as you can see, although we have a lot of work on the body, but the progress for them to start the detecting so long, so everyone be busy running around and setting it up. We do have some tracking in terms of the performance. And we do aware that we will need to look out for the quality because especially they are the we recruit them from outside, right? But maybe I don't have yet any data that I can show for the quality. But let me maybe take in with my own team. I think the previous collection of your sales is good enough, right? So for example, FYP of 5.8, 5.9 billion, how much of that is expected? And then this is your actual simple things like that is good enough in terms of at least at the start. Because I think the question is to move from pilot to full-fledged. The question is, how do we ensure the quality? I think if it works, it works. That's good. We're happy it works. But let's make sure it works well. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So that was the performance. And next would be the summary of the scheme. So we have two of the green one are the MAC scheme. So in terms of agility five, we have the GTF MAC SM only. So it is like a smaller size office. And for this proposal, we are looking to extend it into two sizes. So we have one small size office and another is a bigger size office. And the third one would be we call it the internal MAC. So this option is actually because we are closing down offices. I think in 2026, we are closing down by 16 to 17 of them. So we have a plan for those who are in those branches. They have the options to open the MAC themselves and to still operate in the area. So this is the third one. So for the MAC, when they still receive the SM compensation as a normal SM, as mentioned before, for those MAC that we recruited from outside, like external MAC, they will receive the GTF SM scheme as well. This is the normal GTF scheme that we have. And the third component that they're going to receive as managing the sale office is the MAC scheme. So for MAC scheme, we have the office setup subsidy, which will base on the office cost or cost to set up the office that we will subsidy them. And currently, we are paying them we advance them a third of the money before they start in the construction. And after they finish and complete the construction, we pay the remaining. The second item would be the subsidy to support them in terms of monthly office cost. So this one will be based on the FYP. And because they are newly joined with us, in the first three years, we would give them a minimum support, like a guarantee support if they meet a certain criteria. So this is the third item. And so currently, in terms of our progress, we are working in terms of the expense and cost. The procurement team and the MAC project team, they are working closely with what is a running cost. And also, we are considering between the cities that have a higher living, like higher expense cost compared with the province cities that have much lower expense cost. So we are thinking about whether we need to differentiate the two types of cities and provinces. I have a question, actually. Maybe I'll order one. Actually, when we plan to sign the contract with these GTF MAC, right, how long is your expected contract period? Is it three years, five years, or what? It's three years. So the contract, you're talking about the in terms of the paper documentation? Yeah. Yeah. So I expect something like, "Oh, once you sign with us, within three years, you'll follow these monthly allowance scheme or office set-up subsidies," right? I mean, I just take reference from what I understand from Indonesia case, right? So that's why I just ask a bit of how does it work in your side. So you don't have any specific period or what? Just to get a sense of how does it work. Okay. So when we sign the contract with them, we are telling them that in the first year, we will have these special supports. After the year three, starting from year four, they will only have the variable monthly office allowance. And then apart from that, we would have a maintenance of contract condition. Yeah. So a part of the maintenance of contract condition is if they fail the maintenance, we can stop a certain subsidy. Or if they fail with so we have a few sets of criteria. Let's say if they fail a first set, we will stop the special subsidy. We stop the guarantee. We will just give them the variable. If they fail a second set of criteria, then we will terminate the contract and claw back. So we have a few sets like that. And in your mind, this kind of criteria, is it reviewed annually or half-yearly? Quarterly. Quarterly. So quarterly, since the first year, you track them against these metrics. Yeah. First six months, we will not do the. Right. So first six may be the last period. Okay. And then quarterly, you track against them. If they don't meet, it's more like completely don't have the monthly allowance. Yeah. So for example, okay. I can say if you didn't complete, it's fine. I mean, just get a sense. Because I think I would like the quarterly review, which is good. Because today is something we are pushing also in the other markets. So I think there is one tech MAC, I would say. The first six months, I think that's fine as an onboarding period. That's okay. In terms of your office setup subsidy, I know you separate to two categories based on the size, right? Is it really the size or it's more like city? Because I don't know, does it mean like if they choose to set up in this city because this city may be the first-tier city, you give them option A. And if they are like maybe the second tier, you give them option B. Is it that your consideration instead of the actual I mean, is it how it gets calculated? Yeah. But it's not strictly as cities. You can only have option because within even one city, we have different areas. And these areas, for example, like the inner of that city maybe has more customers than the other skirt of the city, but that same city. So we also so I think our approach is that so this small size can be applied for all the areas. And of course, we have a rule of whether the office needs to be a few kilometers, like 20 kilometers, for example, like 20 kilometers from our branch office and other offices, other MAC offices. But our approach is that this small size is available for everyone, right? Because they are the ones who need to run it and be in charge of it. So it's available for everyone. But for the bigger size office, we would need to have a certain set of criteria. So first of all, the one who is opening it needs to be a BID first so that their team is bigger. And then we also need to consider in terms of the locations. Okay. So it's a—okay. Get it. Get it. Got it. Got it. Okay. Good. But I'll wait for the details then because I think there's a part you're saying you're still working on it. Yeah. Still working on it. So that's why I think we need more time to work out all these details. Yeah. And so for the third one is the internal MAC. So they are our existing leaders in the agency. But because we are closing down the office, they have no office to do work. So we have given them an option whether they can open the MAC themselves. But still, they still need to go through our interviews with the MAC committee and all the checking of the reference additional format before they can receive the offer to open the MAC. And once they open the MAC, all the MAC compensation will only be based on the new agent after they open the MAC. So basically, they will still have earning their SM compensation based on their existing as normal. But to be eligible to earn any subsidy under the MAC scheme, the MAC scheme will only be based on their new team after they open the office. This makes sense. This one is a new—is it a new proposal as well just on this internal MAC? So basically, it's more a transition scheme for those which we asked them to shut down to go to this scheme, right? Yeah. Okay. I mean, if you have a reference, how many people we will take these, I think good to know. But I mean, I don't comment for now. Maybe we will see the full proposal first. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Next would be on the monitoring of the MAC office support. So for the setup, we will have a cost. We will do the signage, the board, the signage ourselves. And then we will give them a subsidy for them to do all the construction inside and the equipment and the furnishing of the location, the office. And for the second component, which is the monthly office subsidy, they will receive 8% of the FYP they generated multiplied with the P13 and the office quality modifier. So the office quality is also a quality check carried out by the Corporate Head Asset Team on a quarterly basis. And so for the first three years, we will give them a guaranteed monthly office subsidy for the first three years if they meet the active requirement and the activities requirement. So if they meet if they qualify the activity requirement but they fail the number of active agents requirement, then they will receive half of the guaranteed amount. And if they, for example, if they qualify both of the criteria in the first three years, we will give them 40 million in terms of the office subsidy for monthly basis minus the 8% that we calculated. So basically, the maximum they earn is 40 million for the office funding. And then we lower this guaranteed amount will be lower in the third year because this guaranteed amount is supposed to help them in the early period that when they first join, their sale and bringing people in, their sale is not big enough to sustain the office running cost. So we help them with the guaranteed minimum amount for them to run the office. And from the third year, we expect them to start surviving on their own FYP with the 8%. So that's why we lower the guaranteed amount. And the second is we allow them to catch up on the guaranteed amount. So every six months after the first six months, and then after that is every three months, we allow them to catch up on both of the conditions of the activities they organize and the activations that they need. And then for those who recruiting, the manager who recruit these GTF MAC, we will have to support with a WING PACK two bonus for them. One is the recruitment bonus, which is one of 50 million if the candidate is successfully signed with us. And building up the office. The second one is on monthly basis for the first 12 months of the MAC office, they will receive a 3% FYP of the MAC office. And we have a maximum of 100 million per month for the first 12 months. And then one quick question from me is on the active agent benchmark. I saw you have 10 per month, right? How did you come up with that? Just quick logic. So this is for the supervisor office, and this will be running by the SM. So we based on the GDFSM target of the GDF scheme deriving to the one-month active. So it's aligned to what their target of? The SM, yeah. But how do we know if this is too relaxed or not aggressive enough or aggressive enough? How's the kind of sense of that? So actually, based on the—so clearly, what we do is we just base on the FYP and derive it to be one active. But in terms of other benchmarking, let me think. Because normally, for the normal venue SM, like the internal SM, the one-month activity is also derived from the FYP like that. So if we compare, it's also similar. So I mean, one you can say, yeah, like you mentioned, one maybe you give some support or you say, "Must our median SM for normal branch," for example, right? I mean, just give some examples and support how you come up with the 10. And again, this one-month AA, this threshold is applied to every MAC, right? You don't separate again by city or by different rank. Well, this is our current pilot scheme. So for the pilot scheme, we only have one small-sized office and only one branch SM. Yeah. But when we extend it to a bigger size and also when we differentiate between cities, we also need to look at whether we need to differentiate this one. Of course, if we have a bigger-sized office, we must also have a bigger number of requirements of people in office. So that would definitely differ for the bigger-sized office. But in terms of different same size but different cities, I don't think it will be the case. Or maybe it—yeah, I think different cities should absorb different from my view. Okay. Okay. Thanks. We'll look into it. Yeah. And next would be on the current MOC that we are denying for our pilot MAC. So for the MOC, they would have the MOC self. So because we only have the MAC office, so we only have one rank of SM, which is the SM to open the MAC office. So the current MOC of the MAC office is based on the MOC of the SM. But within the first year, the GDFSM will not have any MOC within the first year. The MOC doesn't really work for the GDFSM. So that's why we have an additional criteria of failing. If they fail the less than 50% of the everything target for two consecutive quarters in the first year, then we will also stop the guarantee office subsidy. So basically, let me summarize this one because it's a bit detailed. So for the MAC contract, the contract to open the office will terminate if the owner fails the SM MOC. It's always intermittent if the owner fails the SM MOC or if they have a problem with the quality in terms of DC, P13, or the office quality. And other than that, we will keep the contract so that they can still open the office and earn an 8% variable on the sales that they bring in. But we will stop all the subsidy or the special support in the first three years, which is a guaranteed amount on monthly basis so that they can run. So basically, if they are not failing the SM MOC but their performance, then they will have to survive on their own by the FYP that they bring in. And they no longer receive our support in terms of guarantee money allowance. Yeah. So that was for the MOC. And once the MOC happens, we will also have some clawback conditions. So when the MAC, when they fail in terms of the performance, we will claw back 50% of the setup costs that we subsidy. But we will not claw back the monthly allowance that they have sponsored them. When the MAC contract ends or when they fail the MOC due to the line 1B or DC, or when they resign, they resign themselves with us, then we claw back 100% of everything we have paid. But any other reason that we have not foreseen, then the company has the right to claw back from 50% to 100% that subjects to our decision. Okay. I don't have further comments for now. Okay. So what we need to—we're still working on this one is since we're going to have a second-size offices. So yeah, I think that the rank of the people opening—so for the example, a DID, after running the scheme and speaking with the same team, they say that even a DID, they wanted to open a MAC themselves in a small province. Then currently, our scheme is not able for them to do so. So what we needed to do is in terms of the MAC scheme and MOC, we are working on the MAC office maintenance of contract criteria alone, separate from the MOC of the rank because we may have different rank people opening the same size of offices. So we try to separate that. We're working on the criteria. Yeah. The only thing I'll think of to supplement what the performance is, I'm keen to see for each of the branch how's their MOC or active ratio versus your breakdown, for example, right? I think it would be good to see even I think 10 is pretty low. But towards our big branch right now, how many are they? Currently, there's only one—the first one choice is after six months. So they are starting to have MOC. So for that one, they pass this one. Yeah. But for the others, maybe just give a sense, like how many activations are there if there is a core evaluation metrics from—I mean, at least for these two pages. Yeah. Okay. So I think—yeah, yeah. I can update it. But overall, for this remaining, they seem like there's not yet any warning in terms of meeting the MOC. But when I pull up the detail of the team, I will put that in so that you can have a sense. Yeah. Yep. Okay. All right. That would be very—okay. So I think—so just to recap, what I need to do is that in terms of the performance of the pilot that we have recapped earlier, the sale quality, more in terms of the details. We also need a sense of how many MAC is coming up in the first half, in the upcoming, and the tracking in terms of the MOC. And then we'll look into the detail of the scheme and get back to you. And I actually think of one part for—I think it will be good if Hina and you can come up with just one page, right? What is our vision towards MAC, right? Because if we are approving this scheme, what are the ambitions to achieve in two years' time, let's say? And now, like you mentioned, it's contributed less than 1 or 5 percent that you mentioned. Yeah. But after this, what is your ambition? I mean, ambitions, right? I mean, something like that as a page as well. It would be good as well to visualize. Because right now, as I see, it's not pilot anymore. So we should have a structured plan. That's why we go through the compensation review. So good to have that as well as a vision to understand. Okay. I think that's it. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Thanks. Have a good holiday, by the way. Enjoy. Happy New Year. Happy New Year. Happy New Year. Bye-bye. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Always for this game. Really? Yeah.
