MAC (Manulife ... ) - initiative to grow in organically => industry hire from competitor companies' leaders. over there they're manager
ours is branch model => we own the branches, good in good times - lower costs high revenues. last year was bad.
competitors are General Agency groups model => 

Prospective customers are in provincials. Branch isn't as good a model. SLow to expand => MAC is to solve this. Inorganically. chi ph

CE - controllable expenses
PRE - production-related expense

last 2 years, scandal issue => strengthen our presence in Ha Noi, Ho Chi Minh. most revenues are from top 10 regions. sales are anchored in offices

MAC (Manulife Agency Center) is hybrid approach smaller than our typical branches.

SM (Sales Managers) can open MAC centers farther from current branches. "compensation" existing, with on top MAC scheme to help them operate independently these centers. they are responsible for lots of things: hiring staffs, center operations, etc. also hire from other leaders from competitors, somewhat already financially secure leaers MOC (maintenance of contract). RH (regional head)
we're proposing this MAC to regional offices. since last year we opened 8 MACs (7 were from external, 1 was from internal). last year was pilot phase. Manulife VIetnam.

Current SM
Growth Task Force (GTF) SM : compensation + GTF + GTF MAC

MAC scheme: monthly allowance + initial setup to get the benefits of a GA model

Hierachy:
- Agents: individual sellers
- UM+: can get commission from agents under them, yet they can sell too
- SM+ groups: give up the ability to sell directly to get commission per contract. They also get compensations based on target sales. there are 10 ranks: Regional Head (RH) is highest, SM/SSM (senior sales manager) is lowest, DRD (director...) is middle, AVP is under RH

MAC pilot 2025 only applicable for SM or SSM. they can open 70m2 offices. their compensations: office setup (300mil VND - 100mil upfront, 200mil in reimbursements), the office itself must be approved but owned by the SM. second is monthly office allowance = 8% of the First Year Premium (FYP) but initially this is expected to be low so first 3 years we guarantee minimum payout with conditions (i.e. sales activities - 20mil VND if not achieving 1 month active agent (1mAA) or 40mil VND if does achieve). there is a catchup mechanism too if the leader SM/SSM able to catchup within 3-6 months
This year, we have big MAC targeting bigger leaders, incoming equivalent to DRD internally . we offer 150m2 offices and the above 3 components: office setup (600mil VND), monthly office allowance still 8% (but at 30mil - 60mil minimum guarantee with sales activities within first 3 years). benefits for the recruiters of big MAC (these recruiters are ofen from internal) 50mil for each MAC recruitment bonus + monthly bonus 3% of FYP within 12 month of MAC and up to 100mil VND for that 12 months

Last year 7 GTF MAC + 1 internal MAC. Internal MAC slightly different: assumed to be already high initially but the 8% plus minimum guarantee is only applicable to new recruits under them after the MAC contract signing

# TASK
- already a cost file for normal MAC. i need to do a similar cost file for big MAC (which is new this year)
- compare to competitors how competitive our compensation. (we have a reference file done for last year normal MAC, not yet for big MAC). but we need to do both (finetune last year file)
