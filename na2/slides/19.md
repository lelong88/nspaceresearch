![Source](../images/19.jpg)

| Risk type | Description | Prob. | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|-------------|-------|--------|------------|
| **Execution risk** | Success of MAC depends on recruiting the right candidate | M | M | • Conduct mandatory document checks to evaluate candidates, including a CIC or similar financial assessment to ensure they have the financial capacity to invest in and manage the office, as well as to address potential clawbacks.<br>• Request candidate references and require ABM to perform reference checks.<br>• Implement a comprehensive interview assessment process involving RHs and AMTs. |
| | Internal conflict with existing SM structure | L | M | • Opening a MAC must received approval and endorsement RHs who also recruit MAC SM<br>• Ensure MAC locations are adequately distanced from existing offices to prevent internal competition with the Agency structure |
| | MAC location | M | M | • MAC location must meet all criteria, including evaluating potential market, determining if the area is under-served, and assessing the current presence of MVL offices.<br>• Cross-check MAC location with previously terminated agents, UM+/PSM+, or customers in blacklisted areas or involved in past company fraud incidents. |
| **Communication risk** | Risk of existing SM+ resistance to MAC scheme | L | M | • The scheme has gone through discussion with RHs to secure their engagement in this scheme. RHs also in Implementation team of this scheme.<br>• Prepare compensation launching plan to ensure effective communication including embed in kick-off sessions |
| **Operational risk** | Risk that system cannot handle new scheme of MAC | L | L | • To brief and work with Corporate Payroll, IT to align on set up payment system and Lega & Tax team for claw-back mechanism<br>• Back-up plan for manual calculation in case of late system check-in with sufficient cross-check |
| **Financial risk** | Risk that participants not pay back the claw back amount | M | L | • In case MAC SM is terminated, all overdue amount will be offset with their payable income before final payment settlement, any remaining amount will follow debt settlement process. Until debt is fully repaid, their agent code still be registered with MVL.<br>*(reference for 2023-2024 experiences on similar advance/ upfront bonus, there are 11 cases claw back of sign-on due to early termination and we have recovered all cases)* |
| | Risks that cost may deviate from the estimate due to changes in the sales pattern in the future, making history a bad proxy for future. | L | L | • Sensitivities suggests that the cost are still within allowable budgets, variance as a result of over target achievement can be offset by remaining balance of reserved budget and other short-term components in BAU PREs<br>• Monthly compensation payout monitoring, comparison of relevant ratios against prior periods or trends to trigger investigations and explanations for material deviation and for timely rebalance cost by reduction of contest. |
