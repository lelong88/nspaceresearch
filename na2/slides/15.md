# Sensitivity Analysis

![Source](../images/15.jpg)

## Total Comp Cost Sensitivity

• The schemes are mostly variable in nature, linking everything to the level of FYC/ FYP produced. If the sales force has some increases productivity, then variable income shall generate higher percentages which will be compensated by lower percentage from fixed or capped bonus component, thus leading to similar level of costing, though not linear in all cases.

## Impact on Total Compensation Payout

*(exclude contests, campaigns & other benefits but include financing scheme)*

| Scenario | APE ('M USD) | Comp Cost to APE % | Total Comp Cost ('M USD) | $ Cost Change Vs Baseline | % Cost Change Vs Baseline |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| APE Base - Growth 33% vs. 2025f | | | | | |
| APE Growth 25% | | | | | |
| APE Growth 20% | | | | | |
| APE Growth 15% | | | | | |
| APE Growth 10% | | | | | |
| **Min Cost to APE % Scenario** | | | | | |
| **Max Cost to FYC % Scenario** | | | | | |

*Note: The table contains multiple scenarios for sensitivity analysis. The green-shaded rows represent different APE growth scenarios (25%, 20%, 15%, 10%) compared to the baseline. The orange/amber-shaded rows highlight the minimum and maximum cost scenarios for comparison purposes. The actual numerical values are not clearly visible in the image due to screen resolution/glare.*
